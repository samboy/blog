# Fair use pictures

## OKCupid2009Men.png
## OKCupid2009Women.png

These pictures are screenshots from a 2009 OKCupid blog which is no
longer online. The use of these images is fair use because, in order to
properly comment on and provide research about a now offline blog whose
data has been copied and distorted, I need to show the original data.

## AngularYellow-ReactBlue-EmberRed.png

This screenshot from Google Trends is provided for commentary;
While Google may be the copyright owner of this screenshot, its use
falls under fair use.

## Git-SHA1.jpg

This low resolution picture contains an image from the Star Trek: The
Next Generation episode "MÃ©nage a Troi", copyright 1990 CBS Studios. I
believe this use of the image qualifies as fair use, since it is only a
very low-resolution single frame, and its use does not harm (indeed it
may even help) the market for the original work.
