<h1>Last night’s special election</a>

<h2>December 3, 2025</h2>
In the last big election of the year, Tennessee voted who would
 represent their 7<sup style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 0; vertical-align: 5px">th</sup> congressional district. This is a very key
 election.

<h3>The election</h3>
<p>Last night, we had an election for who would represent Tennessee’s
 7<sup style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 0; vertical-align: 5px">th</sup> congressional district at the federal level. This election was for
 a seat in the House of Representatives.
<p>It was a <a href="https://archive.ph/20251202154945/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/02/tennessee-special-election-behn-van-epps-trump/">very closely watched  election</a> 
because it is a bellwether of just
 how satisfied voters are with the right-wing politicians currently in
 power.
<p>While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Virginia_Attorney_General_election">Virginia</a> 
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_York_City_mayoral_election">New  York</a> 
were very successful for Democrats (the left-wing), with
 someone who has <a href="https://archive.today/20250614180707/https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1277414510131916801">voiced support for defunding the  police</a> 
(yes, <a href="https://archive.today/20251015221357/https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/15/mamdani-apology-nypd-00610378">he apologized for this later</a>) 
winning the New York mayoral race.
<p>While these were notable victories for Democrats in 2025, both
 happened in very blue states: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election">Virginia last voted a Republican for president  in 2004</a> 
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_United_States_presidential_election">we have to go all the way back to 1984 to find New York voting for a  Republican</a>. 
One could make the argument that these victories mainly show
 greater polarization in today’s social-media driven political climate,
 with blue voters voting more blue. Perhaps red voters will vote more
 red come the midterms next year.
<p>Or maybe not.
<p>Tennessee’s 7<sup style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 0; vertical-align: 5px">th</sup> congressional district is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee%27s_7th_congressional_district">very  red</a>; 
the last two congressional elections have been 60-38%
 blowouts, with the blue (Democrat) candidate losing by 22 points. So,
 if the polarization theory is true, we would expect the blue candidate
 to lose by even more points, perhaps having a 65-33% blowout.
<p>That’s not what happened.
<p>While <a href="https://archive.ph/20251203125007/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/live-results-tennessee-7th-congressional-district-special-election#selection-2313.0-2313.13">Matt Van Epps did  win</a>, 
it was not a blowout. It was a 54-45%
 victory, with him leading only by 9 points in a district where
 Republicans have previously won by over 20 points. At one point, there
 was even a <a href="https://archive.ph/20251203014449/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/live-results-tennessee-7th-congressional-district-special-election">blue mirage</a>, 
where the blue candidate was actually leading Van Epps
 by over five points.
<p>The Democrat’s (i.e. blue) candidate, one Behn, is no blue dog
 moderate. She has <a href="https://archive.today/20251203155324/https://www.wsmv.com/2025/05/14/tn-rep-andy-ogles-calls-investigation-into-nashville-leadership-obstructing-ice-operations/">chased ICE agents, filming confrontations with them</a>.
<p>Indeed, one very left-leaning site says that <a href="https://archive.ph/20251203033450/https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/12/2/2356597/-Given-the-Tennessee-special-election-result-the-GOP-is-so-f-d-in-2026">this looks really bad for Republicans</a>, 
and with good reason: A
 nationwide 15-point move leftward would be a bloodbath for Republicans
 in the midterms next year.
<p>Based on the elections we have had this year, it looks like a blue
 tide is rising after Trump’s victory in 2024.
