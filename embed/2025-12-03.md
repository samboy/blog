# Last night’s special election
## December 3, 2025

In the last big election of the year, Tennessee voted who
would represent their 7^th congressional district.  This was a very key
election.

### The election

Last night, we had an election for who would represent Tennessee’s 7^th
congressional district at the federal level.  This election was for
a seat in the House of Representatives.  

It was a [very closely watched 
election](https://archive.ph/20251202154945/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/02/tennessee-special-election-behn-van-epps-trump/)
because it is a bellwether of just how satisfied voters are with
the right-wing politicians currently in power.

While 
[Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Virginia_Attorney_General_election)
and [New 
York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_York_City_mayoral_election) were
very successful for Democrats (the left-wing), with someone who has
[voiced support for defunding the 
police](https://archive.today/20250614180707/https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1277414510131916801) 
(yes, [he apologized for this later](https://archive.today/20251015221357/https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/15/mamdani-apology-nypd-00610378)) 
winning the New York mayoral race.

While these were notable victories for Democrats in 2025, both happened
in very blue states: [Virginia last voted a Republican for president 
in 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election)
and [we have to go all the way back to 1984 to find New York voting for
a 
Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_United_States_presidential_election).  
One could make the argument that these victories mainly show greater
polarization in today’s social-media driven political climate, with 
blue voters voting more blue.  Perhaps red voters will vote more red
come the midterms next year.

Or maybe not.

Tennessee’s 7^th congressional district is [very 
red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee%27s_7th_congressional_district);
the last two congressional elections have been 60-38% blowouts, with the
blue (Democrat) candidate losing by 22 points.  So, if the polarization
theory is true, we would expect the blue candidate to lose by even more
points, perhaps having a 65-33% blowout.

That’s not what happened.

While [Matt Van Epps did 
win](https://archive.ph/20251203125007/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/live-results-tennessee-7th-congressional-district-special-election#selection-2313.0-2313.13),
it was not a blowout.  It was a 54-45% victory, with him leading only
by 9 points in a district where Republicans have previously won by 
over 20 points.  At one point, there was even a [blue
mirage](https://archive.ph/20251203014449/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/live-results-tennessee-7th-congressional-district-special-election),
where the blue candidate was actually leading Van Epps by over five
points.

The Democrat’s (i.e. blue) candidate, one Behn, is no blue dog moderate.  She
has [chased ICE agents, filming confrontations with
them](https://archive.today/20251203155324/https://www.wsmv.com/2025/05/14/tn-rep-andy-ogles-calls-investigation-into-nashville-leadership-obstructing-ice-operations/).

Indeed, one very left-leaning site says that [this looks really bad
for Republicans](https://archive.ph/20251203033450/https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/12/2/2356597/-Given-the-Tennessee-special-election-result-the-GOP-is-so-f-d-in-2026),
and with good reason: A nationwide 15-point move leftward would be a
bloodbath for Republicans in the midterms next year.

Based on the elections we have had this year, it looks like a blue tide
is rising after Trump’s victory in 2024.
