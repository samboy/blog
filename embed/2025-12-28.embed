<h1>2025 in summary</h1>

I summarize 2025 and look at a Substack which refutes pretty much all
 of the lies Incel/<![if gt IE 6]>&#8203;<![endif]><wbr>RedPill men say.

<em>The late Charlie 
 Kirk</em>
<p>In 2025, I have come to realize just how hateful and vile the left
 wing media has become. As just one example, Charlie Kirk was
 assassinated in cold blood for his beliefs, and the left wing. even <a href="https://archive.today/20250923222010/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/23/charlie-kirk-bigoted-far-right-podcaster">mainstream leftist newspapers</a>, 
either overtly or covertly <a href="blog:2025-09-11">celebrated his death</a>.
<p>The left wing’s hatred of men, especially white men, is pretty
 disgusting. Just one example from this week: “<a href="https://archive.ph/20251226131010/https://www.vox.com/culture/473273/american-women-expat-trad-wife-opt-out">female readers [have] the  fantasy of opting out of unpredictable and potentially violent human men  and going for fairies or gentle blue aliens  instead</a>”.
<p>In terms of my personal life, I moved out of the United States and
 now live in Mexico. My daughter is learning Spanish and I now have a
 girlfriend. I am really healing in Mexico from the hatred directed
 towards men, in particular white men, by radical left wing misandrist
 women in the United States.
<p>It’s unfortunate that radical left-wing women <a href="https://archive.ph/20251229035520/https://x.com/lolitadiariess/status/2004751168069575141">hate men who leave Western culture to find love</a>, 
using the overused
 and inaccurate stereotype that women in a Latin country live in tin
 huts and have no real attraction towards the men they are dating.

<em>There actually 
 is little polygyny in the real world</em>
<p>Incels and “Red Pill” men claim there is widespread polygyny (i.e.
 few men with many female sex partners). However, the evidence doesn’t
 show that. The Nuance Pill has posted a lot of articles using extensive
 research to show that Incels are spreading lies. To wit:
