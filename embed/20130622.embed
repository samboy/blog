<h1>MaraDNS Update</h1>
<h2>June 22, 2013</h2>
I have updated MaraDNS to incorporate a one-line bugfix with Deadwood
(MaraDNSâ€™s recursive resolver) in to the codebase.  The name of
this release is MaraDNS 2.0.07b (for more details on the
unusual naming patterns,

<p>

This will hopefully stop

that occasionally pop up on the mailing list.

While not a hard-and-fast rule, my plan is to work on MaraDNS or Deadwood
again one day in a couple of months unless a critical security bug with
a CVE number is found.
