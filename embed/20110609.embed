<h1>x120e getting replaced?</h1>

<h2>June 9, 2011</h2>

There is a chance that the excellent Lenovo x120e is going to be 
replaced by an updated x121e.  To wit:

<p>
<ul>

<li>The x120e is no longer available for sale at <A 
href=http://lenovo.com>Lenovo.com</A>

<li>One anonymous blog commenter (by the moniker "magnum") has 
    <A href=http://semiaccurate.com/2011/06/07/lenovos-x120e-and-amds-brazos-platform/>reported</A>
    that this will soon be replaced by a "x121e" computer.

</ul>

One issue I would like to see Lenovo resolve is the wait time to get
an x120e; before Lenovo pulled the computer, the wait time to get one 
was over four weeks long.
