Are H1B Visas no more?

### H1B Visas

Trump is in the process of discouraging H1B visas by [charging $100,000
for them](https://archive.today/20250920103958/https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/19/politics/trump-h1b-visa-fee). 

As much as progressives bewail Trump, Trump did something fundamentally
progressive here.

To use the language of progressives, the CEO class took away jobs from
hard working and skilled Americans by giving them to H1B hires instead,
lowering wages and worsening working conditions. By effectively stopping
H1B Visas, he is redistributing wealth so that more middle class working
Americans can have a living wage.

I find it supremely ironic how [progressives decry this
move](https://archive.today/20250920162335/https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/9/19/2344529/-White-House-Every-H1-B-Visa-Holder-must-pay-USD-100K-to-re-enter-the-country?pm_campaign=front_page&pm_source=more_community&pm_medium=web) when they have been wanting less money for
the CEO class and more money in the hands of “hard working Americans”
for so many years.

H1B Visas were originally designed to allow people of “distinguished
merit and ability” to temporarily work in the US, but they have been
abused by technology companies to hire foreigners for less money
when perfectly skilled American technology workers are available.

It’s good to see Trump put a clamp on this abuse.

### Blog update

I have moved the blog from my personal webpage to my GitHub repo. 
While, in 2011, it made sense to make each blog entry as small as possible
to minimize load times, here in 2025, the _entire_ blog (including pictures)
is only about 12 megabytes in size, small enough to quickly load even on 
a slow 4g network.

This way, people can just scroll down to read more blog entries.
