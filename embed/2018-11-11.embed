<h1>Deadwood 3.2.13 released</h1>
<h2>November 11, 2018</h2>
I have released Deadwood 3.2.13.  Nothing in the server has changed; only
the testing framework has been updated

<p>

<p>

In Deadwood 3.2.13, I have updated the SQA suite to run again.  The main
issue is that Dig, when used to run DNS-over-TCP has changed and no longer
works with Deadwood; that in mind, I have updated the tests to no longer
use Dig, but use a tool I wrote myself instead for the DNS-over-TCP tests.

<p>

Only the SQA tests have been updated; no code changes to the
Deadwood daemon have been made.

<p>

That in mind, I am only releasing the source code to Deadwood 3.2.13,
and will not update MaraDNS to use the new version of Deadwood.  The
Windows binaries will remain at 3.2.12.

<p>

The code is available here:

</blockquote>

I have also updated the GitHub version of the code:

<p>

For too long, I have been a grousy old-school *NIX graybeard.  I 
strive to improve myself as a person; that means the days of replying
to support requests with dismissive RTFMs are over.  In more detail,
I now strive to have all of my public interactions, especially with
regards to my open source development, follow the 
<a href="https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct</a>.

<p>

Itâ€™s pretty simple: I will respect others as human beings.  I will be
kind and considerate.  I will be empathetic towards others.

<p>

I think this change will make me a more happy person, and make my
online interactions more pleasant.
