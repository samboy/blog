# Life in México
## November 19, 2025

I discuss my life in México briefly, as well as discuss gerrymandering.

### Living down here

Life is going really well in México.  It’s very different than it was
when I last lived here 16 years ago: With WhatsApp and reasonably priced
international calling, and with more culture being online instead of
face to face, it’s a lot easier for me to keep in touch with all of my
friends in the United States than it was back then.  I got very homesick
back then; these days, I get both all of my friends in United States as
well as being able to enjoy the beautiful weather and warm friendly people
down here.

I am regularly going to church down here—the people here in México have
a lot of faith in God—and I am currently Christian dating someone I met
at church.  Whether or not we take our relationship to the next level is
still up in the air, but I enjoy the friendship I have with her.

### Gerrymandering

*Gerrymandering* is the unethical practice of redrawing congressional
districts to give one political party more power than the other party.

The latest news with gerrymandering is this:

* Texas [created a new congressional 
  map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Texas_redistricting) designed so 
  that Republicans would have more seats in the US House of Representatives.

* California retaliated by [creating their own congressional 
  map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_California_Proposition_50) which
  gives Democrats more seats in the House.

* And now, [a court has said Texas’s gerrymandered map is
  not allowed](https://archive.today/20251118185927/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/18/texas-redistricting-house-judge/)

Gerrymandering is straight up unethical, because it does not allow 
voters to have their voices heard.  But, if one side does it, the
only logical thing is for the other side to do it.

It’s an open question how the Supreme Court will decide on this entire
ugly gerrymandering battle.  Ideally, they will throw out *both*
California’s new map and Texas’s new map.  

Trump won fair and square in 2024, and it’s best if both sides feel
that elections are fair.

I, for one, have found the polarizing politics of the US really ugly,
and the culture has become more unfriendly and cold, to the point I 
just had to get out of Dodge.
