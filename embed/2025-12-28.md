# 2025 in summary
## December 28, 2025

I summarize 2025 and look at a Substack which refutes pretty much all of the
lies Incel/RedPill men say.

### 2025 in summary

_The late Charlie Kirk_

In 2025, I have come to realize just how hateful and vile the
left wing media has been.  As just one example, Charlie Kirk was
assassinated in cold blood for
his beliefs, and the left wing. even [mainstream leftist
newspapers](https://archive.today/20250923222010/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/23/charlie-kirk-bigoted-far-right-podcaster),
either overtly or covertly [celebrated his death](blog:2025-09-11).

The left wing’s hatred of men, especially white men, is pretty
disgusting.  Just one example from this week: “[female readers [have]
the fantasy of opting out of unpredictable and potentially violent human
men and going for fairies or gentle blue aliens 
instead](https://archive.ph/20251226131010/https://www.vox.com/culture/473273/american-women-expat-trad-wife-opt-out)”.

In terms of my personal life, I moved out of the United States and now live 
in Mexico.  My daughter is learning Spanish and I now have a girlfriend.  I
am really healing in Mexico from the hatred directed towards men, in 
particular white men, by radical left wing misandrist women in the United
States.

### Incel lies: Refuted

_There actually is little polygyny in the real world_

Incels and “Red Pill” men claim there is widespread polygyny (i.e. few men
with many female sex partners).  However, the evidence doesn’t show that.
The Nuance Pill has posted a lot of articles using extensive research to
show that Incels are spreading lies.  To wit:

* [You don’t have to be tall to be sexually active](https://archive.ph/20251225000746/https://nuancepill.substack.com/p/height-and-sexual-success)
* [Polygyny is not the norm](https://archive.ph/20250409072201/https://nuancepill.substack.com/p/was-polygyny-widespread-in-history)
* [How much have dating apps affected the sexual marketplace](https://archive.ph/20250801101301/https://nuancepill.substack.com/p/have-dating-apps-ruined-dating)
* [Are only physically attractive guys having sex?](https://archive.ph/20251016183211/https://nuancepill.substack.com/p/male-looks-and-sexual-success)
* [While relatively few people are promiscuous, the rates are the same for women and men](https://archive.ph/20250801101409/https://nuancepill.substack.com/p/the-chad-myth). Also, STD rates confirm people don’t lie on those surveys.
* [No, most women don’t sleep around in their 20s and settle in their 30s](https://archive.ph/20250611045106/https://nuancepill.substack.com/p/the-promiscuity-myth).
* [Only about 30% of couples meet online](https://archive.ph/20251223030351/https://nuancepill.substack.com/p/how-many-couples-meet-online)
* [What percentage of men do women find attractive?](https://archive.ph/20251223030351/https://nuancepill.substack.com/p/how-many-couples-meet-online)
