# Lack of empathy
## September 11, 2025

I look at the escalation of political violence and how both the left
and right are in a place where they are losing empathy for people
whose views they disagree with.

### Remembering Charlie Kirk

For people who have been under a rock for the last 24 hours, one
Charlie Kirk was murdered yesterday. We have not caught the killer
(yet!) nor know their motives right now, but I do know that there
are people on the left who are either [covertly](https://archive.ph/kSeXi)
or [overtly](https://archive.ph/boUei) celebrating his death.

We have lost basic decency and empathy in our culture. I think _a lot_
of it has to do with the online culture. I remember, in the early days of
online culture, there were these people I knew in real life, and they were
perfectly polite and decent people when we interacted in the real world,
but once they got behind a computer screen, they lost all civility and
would be very confrontational and rude.

This online rudeness wasn’t considered, at the time, “real” behavior,
but now with multiple generations of people who see online interactions
as normal, the rudeness online is being reflected in the real world,
one example being the [“Generation Z 
Stare”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Z_stare). 

Someone has now been killed in cold blood, and people are celebrating
his death. This online rudeness is becoming deadly. I hope people can
learn respect, decency, and empathy for others sooner rather than
later, before we descend in to another civil war. 

9/11 unified us as a nation. Online culture is dividing us in very ugly
ways. I yearn for the unity we had post-9/11 again.
