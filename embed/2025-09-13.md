# Lua Table sorter, etc.
## September 13, 2025

Let’s look at a Lua Table sorter. 

### A simple Lua table sorter

This routine works like the `pairs()` function included with Lua, but
the table keys are sorted:

```
-- Like pairs() but sorted
-- All table keys should be
-- of the same type
function sPairs(inputTable)
  local keyList = {}
  local index = 1
  for k,_ in 
      pairs(inputTable) do
    table.insert(keyList,k)
  end
  table.sort(keyList)
  return function()
    rvalue = keyList[index]
    index = index + 1
    return rvalue,
         inputTable[rvalue]
  end
end
```

### Cancelling people who celebrate Charlie Kirk’s death

Cancel culture is in full force again, this time [cancelling people
who are celebrating Charlie Kirk’s 
death](https://archive.ph/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/charlie-kirk-death-teachers-professors-nationwide-fired-disciplined-s-rcna230845).

This comes off as _different_ than the cancel culture we had in 2020.  As
I blogged about at the time, [David Shor was cancelled for wanting to
_reduce_ violence](blog:2020-06-16). This time around, people are being
cancelled (losing their jobs, being placed on administrative leave, etc.)
for _encouraging_ violence.[^1 When confronted with these accusations,
the people who have encouraged violence respond by gaslighting—i.e. 
denying that what they say encourages violence. Saying that Charlie Kirk
was a bad person because he said something which goes against the modern
leftist agenda is implying maybe he deserved to die for what he said.](fn:1)

The problem is this: _Both_ the left and the right have elements which
want to use violence to resolve our differences of opinion. This will 
lead to a more violent and less safe society.
