# Lies about Orwell
## November 13, 2025

I refute some lies being said about Orwell making the rounds on 
left-wing social media, and look at the reaction to the shutdown
ending.

### The lies about Orwell

*1984* is supposed to be a warning, not a guidebook.  Something the
radical left wing forgets.  They take a page straight out of *1984*
in an effort to disregard what Orwell says.

They make unproven (and probably false) accusations of Orwell raping
women or having affairs on his wife.  The source of these accusations
come from someone named Ms. Funder.  She makes an entire [Gish
gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop) of accusations about
Orwell’s life.

Funder’s issue is this: Orwell engaged in “crimethink” for not adhering
to 21^st century radical leftist feminist thinking, accusing him
of engaging in “misogyny” — i.e. “crimethink”.

Her claims are dubious, and have been refuted by historians who study
Orwell extensively.  [She made claims that Orwell didn’t care about his
wife when writing about her](https://archive.today/20250921205743/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileen_Blair#Eileen_O%27Shaughnessy%27s_role_in_Spain,_and_Orwell%27s_account_of_it),
but historians have looked at her claims and found them to be without
merit.

Funder also claimed that [Orwell slept with one Celia 
Kirwan](https://archive.today/20231111154750/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/11/row-sex-claims-book-george-orwell-marriage),
but that claim is so dubious, Funder’s book was revised to omit the
claim.  

Funder didn’t even get Orwell’s country of birth correct.

Point being, progressives attempt to discredit Orwell, because, in their
world, unless you agree with every single one of their man-hating 
misandrist talking points, you are engaging in “crimethink” and
they will use dubious claims to discredit you.

### The shutdown is over. Progressives weep.

The radical left is [upset](https://archive.today/20251112011350/https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/11/11/democrats-collapsed-in-the-shutdown-fight)
that the shutdown has ended.  Indeed, on left wing social media, people
feel [the shutdown](https://archive.today/20251112022551/https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/11/10/2353086/-Hey-Apologists-For-Senate-Centrists-Caving-Even-THIRD-WAY-CONDEMNS-THE-VOTE-TO-END-GOVT-SHUTDOWN)
should [had

If Democrats want to get their policies to pass, they need to become
attractive to voters.  Right now, both houses of congress and the White
House are controlled by Republicans.  Democrats do not have power because the
voters decided they don’t want them to be in control.  Trump won in
2024, fair and square.  For progressives to try and hold the nation
hostage to get policies the majority do not support is reprehensible.
I [opposed the 2013 Republican 
shutdown](blog:2014-01-08#87_Republicans_who_are_still_sane) and I
opposed the 2025 Democrat party shutdown.
