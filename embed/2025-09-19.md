# HTMLDOC and Unicode
## September 19, 2025

I go over how I process blog entries.

### Processing the blog

I use a hacked version of [HTMLDOC](https://www.msweet.org/htmldoc/)
to process my blog entries. The entries are written in a special version
of Markdown which is then processed as follows:

Markdown → UTF-8 to Xascii converter → HTMLDOC → Lua script → HTML webpage

The steps are as follows:

* I write the blog in Markdown
* Since HTMLDOC doesn’t like Unicode (in theory, it has the ability to
  accept UTF-8 input. In practice, this is so buggy it’s simply better
  to convert it in to a non-Unicode format first), I convert the Unicode
  in to a special 7-bit format called Xascii.
* I use a slightly hacked version of HTMLDOC 1.9.16 (the last version which
  easily compiles in Cygwin) to convert the Markdown in to HTML
* Since that HTML isn’t quite in a form suitable for my blog, I run it
  through a Lua script which uses a bunch of regular expressions to massage
  the HTML (real footnotes,[^1 Like this footnote](fn:1) pictures, split 
  long words so there aren’t issues on a phone, etc.) using Lua’s 8-bit 
  regular expression engine (with some extensions to support the unusual 
  Xascii format I use). Here keeping things 8-bit is good because then the
  regular expressions can process non-ASCII. Said Lua engine outputs UTF-8
  HTML suitable for putting on my blog.
* I have a final script which takes those (mostly) HTML blog entries and
  puts them on both of my blogs (inter-blog links are different between
  the two blogs)

### The Xascii format

Instead of using UTF-8, which HTMLDOC doesn’t really like, we use a format
called Xascii which I actually made up about seven years ago, with no 
intention of using it in the real world. It was at the time a “fantasy”
encoding for an alternate universe where low end computers would use this
encoding to encode both English and Spanish, as well as some limited 
non-ASCII punctuation.

Since both HTMLDOC and Lua prefer to get fix-width 8-bit input (HTMLDOC
is buggy with UTF-8 and Lua’s 8-bit regular expression engine treats
UTF-8 as multi character entities, so they can’t be part of regular
expression classes and what not), this fantasy format finally became a
reality since I had a real world use for it. The format is as follows:

```
  0123456789abcdef
0 .ÁÉÍÑÓÚÜ¡..—..«»
1 •áéíñóúü¿‘’.→“”©
2 .!"#$%&'()*+,-./
3 0123456789:;<=>?
4 @ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO
5 PQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_
6 `abcdefghijklmno
7 pqrstuvwxyz{|}~♥
```

Here, “.” (except for 0x2e, the literal period) is a control
character. Note that “—” uses the slot for the very rarely used
“vertical tab”, so I have hacked HTMLDOC to not consider “vertical
tab” a whitespace character, and on the Lua side I have code which
massages regular expressions so that the custom class `%b` matches all
whitespace characters _except_ “vertical tab”.

The fonts I use to render the webpage have essentially only the
characters that are present in Xascii; this allows the font
files to be really small and load very quickly, even on older
networks (down here in México, on my phone 4g is nearly universal 
and 5g is almost never available).

This is perfect for my blog, since I only write in English
and Spanish. I have all of the non-ASCII control characters I need
for my blogs, and can use long term simple stable tools to build
the blog.
