<h1>New MaraDNS snapshot</h1>

<h2>March 18, 2011</h2>

In today's snapshot of MaraDNS, I have updated the documentation (namely,
the webpage source that is bundled with MaraDNS).

<p>

As a note, while the next scheduled day for me to work on MaraDNS would be
April 1, I actually will be busy that day.  Barring a critical security bug,
the next day I will work on MaraDNS is April 15, 2011, four weeks from today.
