# Left-wing lies
## September 10, 2025

As I type these words, right wing political activist Charlie Kirk
has been shot dead in cold blood. We do not know who killed him
or what their motive was, but it appears to be a left-wing
motivated political killing. 

We have come to the point where political killings of people we
disagree with is considered acceptable. There is something wrong
with the political climate in the United States causing people
to think that killing someone is cold blood is somehow OK. 

While it is true that the political right spreads lies, the left-wing
media has also been very dishonest, spreading misinformation.

I will list just two examples of how the political left either ignores
or downright has lied when confronted with inconvenient truths.

### How the left lied about Alcoholics Anonymous

Alcoholics Anonymous is one of the [most effective treatments
for alcoholism](https://archive.ph/Nig4w). Since this goes against
the left-wing anti-God narrative, they have either ignored or 
spread lies about this inconvenient truth.

The left-wing rag Salon published the then false claim that
[“Peer-reviewed studies peg the success rate of AA somewhere between 5
and 10 percent. That is, about one of every fifteen people who enter these
programs is able to become and stay sober.”](https://archive.ph/SBJE3)
even though, at the time, researchers generally felt that [“AA and 12-step
treatments are some of the most effective and cost-effective treatment
approaches for addiction”](https://archive.ph/Z79Ob).

It was not only Salon that spread this lie. [Even NPR parroted the same
lies about AA’s success rate](https://archive.ph/DTtXQ). The Atlantic
took it even further, [using these false figures about AA’s success 
rate to publish an entire novelettes-length anti-AA 
polemic](https://archive.ph/OcyJ5) which _still_ [makes the 
rounds](https://archive.ph/MBYrp) on left-wing social media.

Once the 2020 Cochrane Review of AA came out, proving beyond a shadow of
a doubt that [AA is effective](https://archive.ph/XzDJx),[^1 I know Dr.
Peele published a supposed refutation to the 2020 Cochrane Review that
left-wing anti-AA critics bring up every time someone mentions said 2020
Cochrane review, but those criticisms were not published in a peer-reviewed
journal and were refuted at https://archive.md/tT9fx](fn:1) Both Salon and
The Atlantic completely ignored the science showing AA effectiveness. NPR, 
to their credit, [did report on the 2020 Cochrane 
Review](https://archive.ph/VYyKS), pointing out that AA has a 42% success 
rate compared to the 35% success rate the control treatment reported.

### Richard M. Stallman

As an [open source developer](https://github.com/samboy), I have had the
privilege of meeting the legendary Richard M. Stallman (RMS). During the
#MeToo hysteria, the left dragged RMS through the mud, even though
[he did nothing wrong or anything which reasonably can be considered sexual
harassment, much less sexual 
assault](https://sterling-archermedes.github.io/). An innocent man was
attacked, mainly for having opinions which went against the opinions
the left-wing media believed in, and, as described in the linked page,
the left-wing media downright _lied_ about what RMS said or did.

### Conclusion

The point being this: Yes, the right wing media takes liberties with 
the truth, but the fact of the matter is that the left wing media does
the same thing, distorting the truth to promote their agenda. The 
mainstream media plain simply _cannot_ be trusted, and realizing that
both the left wing and the right wing can be loose with the facts has
done a lot to convert me from being left-wing to being politically
neutral.

When the mainstream media is more interested in spreading outrage
(“flamebait”, as we used to call it) then in spreading knowledge, it
helps cause America to become a more politically divided country, where
the level of anger is going up; this anger could very well had caused
Charlie Kirk to be killed today.
