# Capa720: A Chess Variant proposal
## February 7, 2026

Capablanca Chess is a family of (usually 8x10) Chess variants where
the board is 8 files high but 10 files wide, and the usual Chess
setup has rook + knight (C) and bishop + knight (A) fairy pieces
added to the starting array.

The king moves three squares instead of two when castling.

If the rook remains in the corners, and the king in the center, and
if the bishops are on opposite colors, we have some 720 possible
opening setups (compared to 18 setups when we have the king in the
center and the rooks in the corners in Classic Chess).

I call this set of opening setups Capa720, a family of some 720
different Chess variants.

Pictured above are two world champions, Bobby Fischer (left) and
Mikhail Tal (right) playing a famous 1960 game which ended in a draw;
I discuss a Chess variant rule change which would result in fewer 
draws later on in this blog entry.

### Improving Capablanca Chess

The problem with Capablanca Chess is this:  The game greatly reduces
draws, but this is because the game is a win for White; analysis
indicates, that with perfect play, White always wins.

There are two ways to give Black better chances in Capablanca Chess:

* Changing the opening setup.  One Trice originally proposed lowering
  White’s advantage by carefully choosing a balanced opening 
  setup.@[^1 https://archive.ph/20030711200636/http://gothicchess.org/long_answer.html](fn:1)
* “Pie rule”: Player one chooses White’s first move, and player two
  chooses whether to play White or Black.@[^2 New Rules for Classic Games, 1992, page 25](fn:2)

Let’s look at these two proposals.

### Changing the opening setup

Back in the first 2000s decade, many members of the then Chess Variant
community looked at a large number of possible opening setups.  Here
are the proposed setups with names which I listed back in 
2008:@[^3 https://archive.ph/20090923161739/https://maradns.blogspot.com/2008/12/capa-opening-setups.html](fn:3)

```
Setup           Name               21-ply score
--------------  -----------------  ------------
RBANCKNQBR*     Grotesque          24
RNABCKBQNR*     Finesse            24
RNBQCKABNR      Gothic             27
RNBAQKCBNR      Capa 1             29
RNABQKBCNR      Capa 2             36
RBCNAKNQBR*     Landorean          36
RQNBAKBNCR      Schoolbook         39
RNQBCKBANR      Blackbook          40
RNCBQKBANR      Nalls              40
RBNCQKANBR      Univers            40
RANBQKBNCR      Aberg              43
RNBACKQBNR      Embassy            45
RCNBAKBNQR*     Notebook           47
RNBQAKCBNR      Teutonic           49
RCNBQKBNAR      Carrera            54
RANBCKBNQR*     Narcotic           58
RNBCAKQBNR*     Consulate          60
RNBCQKABNR      Bird               62
* The 2008 setup was a mirror image
```

The setup is the initial array for both Black and White; C is rook +
knight and A is knight + bishop.  The name is the name given to the
setup back in 2008.  The 21-ply score is White’s advantage, in
centipawns (100 centipawns is a 1-pawn advantage).

The best setups (where White has less than a 24-centipawn advantage) are:

```
Setup      21-ply score
---------- ------------
RNBBNKCQAR 17 (h2-h4)
RABNNKCBQR 20 (d1-e3)
RCNBNKAQBR 21 (b1-c3)
RBNANKBCQR 21 (h2-h3)
RNNBQKCABR 22 (b1-c3)
RNABNKQCBR 22 (d2-d4)
RNABBKNQCR 22 (e2-e4)
RABBNKNCQR 23 (d2-d4)
RABNNKQBCR 23 (d2-d4)
RNBBQKNCAR 23 (e2-e4)
RNABNKBQCR 23 (f2-f4)
RBBCNKNQAR 23 (g1-f3)
RNABCKQNBR 23 (h1-i3)
RBCNAKBQNR 23 (h2-h4)
RBBNCKAQNR 23 (i1-h3)
```

Here we see the setup, White’s centipawn advantage, and also the move
White should make to have that advantage.

The setups where White has a 24 centipawn advantage are RNBBAKCQNR,
RNBBQKCNAR, RBANCKNQBR (Grotesque), RNCBNKAQBR, RNABCKBQNR (Finesse),
RBANCKQNBR, and RNCBBKNAQR.

The three worst setups, with a significant advantage for White, are
RQNBCKBNAR (92 centipawns), RAQNBKCBNR (96), and finally RQNABKCBNR
(Where white has a 99 centipawn advantage).

The point being that carefully choosing the opening setup where White
has the minimum advantage reduces White’s advantage from around 35
centipawns to, at most, 17 centipawns.  White still has an edge.

Indeed, if we play 500 games of Finesse Chess (RNABCKBQNR) at 18-ply
depth (this game has a 24 centipawn advantage for White in our 21-ply
analysis), we get these results:

```
500 games played
White 238 47.6%
Draw   89 17.8%
Black 173 34.6%
13% White winning edge
56.5% White score
57.9075% White decisive wins
```

So, of the 500 games played, White won 238, 89 were draws, and Black 
won 173. If we look at only decisive games where either White or Black
wins, White won 57.9% of those games.

Compare this to Classic Chess:

```
White 142 28.4%
Draw  258 51.6%
Black 100 20%
500 games played
8.4% White winning edge
54.2% White score
58.6777% White decisive wins
```

Point being, with a carefully chosen opening setup for Capablanca
Chess, we can reduce White’s advantage to be roughly White’s advantage
in Classic Chess (58.7% decisive games won in Classic Chess, 57.9% in
Finesse Chess).  Since Chess players are happy with White’s edge in
Classic Chess, maybe they would be happy with having the same edge for
White in Finesse Chess, while greatly reducing draws.

Maybe not.  Let’s look at another way of reducing White’s advantage.

### The Pie Rule

We can essentially eliminate White’s edge with the Pie rule.

With the Pie Rule, player one chooses White’s first move, and then
player two chooses whether 
he@[^4 Or she! Judit Polgar recently defeated World Champion Magnus Carlsen in a famous 2022 Skittles Game that they played](fn:4)
is White or Black.  To get a sense of what a Pie Rule game would look
like, let’s look at some good Pie Rule moves for White in Classic
Chess, where neither White nor Black have a significant advantage.
The edge for White is shown in centipawns.

```
Move   White edge
------ ----------
Nc3    0
c3     2
a3     3
d3     -6
```

Enough master games of Chess have been played that we can see how the
Baltic Opening (1. Nc3), Anderssen Opening (1. a3), Saragossa Opening
(1. c3), and Mieses Opening (1. d3) play out.  1. a3 is in particular a
very interesting opening, because it stops Black from playing a reversed
Ruy Lopez (1. a3 e5 2. e4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Bb4?? and now White takes the
bishop) and gives White his tempo back in many reversed Sicilian setups
(e.g. 1. a3 e5 2. c4 Nf6 3. d3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Nf3 Nc6 and now it’s
a reversed Najforf where White has a tempo because he played a3 on the
first move and doesn’t have to play 6. a3).

The big advantage of the Pie Rule is that it eliminates White’s edge
while minimizing the chances of the game being a forced win for Black.
Of the 720 Capa720 setups played, some 490 setups have 1 or more first
moves for White which perfectly balance the game (0 centipawn advantage
for White).  Even with the very unbalanced RQNABKCBNR starting position,
where White has a nearly one pawn advantage, in Pie Rule, we can balance
the position by having White’s first move be one of 1. h4 or 1. Ch3.

While the Pie Rule is a blunt tool for balancing an unbalanced abstract
game, it is also very effective at removing the first player advantage.

Now that we have a way of reducing White’s edge, is there a way we
can make Chess less drawish?

### Ko rule
![widepic](pics/Fischer-Tal-1960-blog.jpg)
_In this famous 1960 game, Tal forces a draw_

One way we can make a drawish game, like Chess, less drawish is to have
a version of the “Ko Rule”, where it is not permitted to have a
previously played position repeated; if a given move repeats a
previously played position, another move has to be made which creates a
position not seen yet in the game being played.  If a player cannot make
a legal move without repeating a previously played position, they lose.

This makes some classic games of Chess, such as Bobby Fischer’s hard
fought draw in 1960 against then reigning World Champion 
Tal@[^5 https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1008399](fn:5)
(pictured), not possible, but it also makes Chess a lot less drawish.

Initial testing with Classic Chess and Finesse Chess shows that draws
are greatly reduced with this rule change.  Here is a 12-ply tourney
played with Ko Rule Classic Chess:

```
White 240 48%
Draw   92 18.4%
Black 168 33.6%
500 games played
14.4% White winning edge
57.2% White score
58.8235% White decisive wins
```

And with Finesse Chess:

```
White 1287 51.48%
Draw    58  2.32%
Black 1155 46.2%
2500 games played
5.28% White winning edge
52.64% White score
52.7027% White decisive wins
```

### Capa720: A proposal

Let me propose Pie Rule Capa720:

* We choose one of the 720 Capa720 setups at random
* Player #1 chooses White’s first move
* Player #2 gets to decide whether to be White or Black

No opening book, minimum draws (and if 20% draws is too much, we can
always also have the Ko rule), and a lot of possibilities for very
tactical dynamic games.
