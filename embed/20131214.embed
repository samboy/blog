<h1>More font updates</h1>
<h2>December 14, 2013</h2>
Yesterday, I 
<a href="http://samiam.org/blog/20131213.html">mentioned</a>
that I was having technical problems with the Windows bitmap conversion
of 
<a href="http://samiam.org/fonts/terminal/WTerm/">WTerm</a>, forcing me to rename
the font WTm.  I have fixed this problem.  I also discuss the Cousine 
font losing its delta hinting.

<p>

The problem is that Windows .fon files are not fully documented, and the
open-source tool I was using to convert the fonts was having issues making
the font one MSYS would recognize.  After hours of trying different things
Fontforge finally made a MSYS-capable .fon file by having three fonts in 
the file, only one of which I used.  The font name was one-letter long; I
changed it to a three-letter name by using a binary editor.

Simon Tatham, the same guy who wrote the PuTTY client I am using to write
this blog, also wrote 
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/fonts/">his own .fon generation scripts in Python.  His scripts
</a>were able to take the hacked-together .fon file and convert it in to
a .fon file with the correct font name (WTermA, to distinguish it from the
scalable WTerm font).  The resulting file is smaller since it now only
has one font in it.

<p>

I have made a local mirror of his scripts and fonts (which, being bitmap
fonts, are public domain in the US):

WTermA, the updated and fixed WTm, is available here:

It has the file name WTermA.fon.  To use this file, download it, then click
on it in Windows to install the font.  After installing the font, it can 
be used in MSYS by modifying msys.bat to look like this:

<p>

<tt>start rxvt -backspacekey -sl 2500 -fg #00c000 -bg #000000 -sr -fn WTermA -tn msys -geometry 80x25+15+15 -e /bin/sh --login -i</tt><br>

<p>

One of the hardest parts of making a font is giving it good hinting. 
This is a tedious, time consuming process.  As a result, very few open-source
fonts include delta hints.

<p>

The best-looking open source with delta hinting has been the monospace
OFL-licensed Cousine.  When I downloaded the new Cousine today, it was
a shock to discover that, when Google changed its license from the OFL
to the Apache license, the updated font no longer has delta hinting.

<p>

That in mind, I have mirrored a copy of the older Cousine with delta
hinting, which can be downloaded here:

<p>

<blockquote>
<A href="http://samiam.org/fonts/terminal/WTerm/">http://<![if gt IE 6]>&#8203;<![endif]><wbr>samiam.<![if gt IE 6]>&#8203;<![endif]><wbr>org/<![if gt IE 6]>&#8203;<![endif]><wbr>fonts/<![if gt IE 6]>&#8203;<![endif]><wbr>terminal/<![if gt IE 6]>&#8203;<![endif]><wbr>WTerm/</A>
</blockquote>

While retina displays will become universal in a decade or so, until then
delta hinting is a technology that allows for crisp, readable fonts on
todayâ€™s displays.
