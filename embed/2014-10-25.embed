<h1>MaraDNS support update</h1>
<h2>October 25, 2014</h2>
Why I have stopped using MyBB, and how to now get MaraDNS support.

<p>

Now that I am a family man, I do not have time to be on the constant 
upgrade treadmill.  MyBB 1.6.4 (which required a lot of core files to be 
replaced to update from the previous 1.6 release) was released three 
years ago, and they now have released 1.8 which requires a lot of 
changes which I would have had to do my hand to update.

<p>

Since 
<a href="http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/search-results?query=MyBB&search_type=all&cves=on">MyBB does not have a great security record</a> (with some 114 CVE results), the 
only way I can keep MyBB reasonably secure is to constantly update it. 
Since they no longer are updating the 1.6 branch, itâ€™s just too much 
bother for me to still use this program.

<p>

That in mind, <A href="http://forum.samiam.org">http://forum.samiam.org</A> is now a static archive of posts 
made there; MyBB has been completely removed. I have added a note at the 
top of every page there on how to get MaraDNS support.

The way to now get MaraDNS support is to file an issue in GitHub:

<p>

<blockquote>
