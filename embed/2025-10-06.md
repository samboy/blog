My thoughts on the fire at Diane Goodstein’s place.

### The fire and the reaction

It would seem that this weekend, there was a fire at the house of one
Diane Goodstein, a judge who Trump does not like. Reddit being Reddit,
they [immediately assumed the fire was arson](https://archive.ph/Bl57o)
and accused the right wing of violence; the linked story made the front
page of Reddit. However, the investigation so far shows no evidence of
arson: “[At this time, there is no evidence to indicate the fire was
intentionally set. SLED agents have preliminarily found there is no
evidence to support a pre-fire explosion](https://archive.ph/U9tjU).

Point being, the radical left (i.e. Reddit) will say
[lie](https://archive.today/20250913064810/https://old.reddit.com/r/BlueskySkeets/comments/1nf48w5/if_it_quacks_like_a_duck/)
after

after
[lie](https://archive.today/20250921132303/https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1nm2owd/doj_cant_tie_suspected_kirk_killer_to_left_like/)@[^1 The 
particular subreddits where these lies were spread do not matter because
*every single one of these stories made the front page of Reddit*.](fn:1)
about how Charlie Kirk’s killer
couldn’t have possibly done it because of his
left-wing beliefs, even though [the evidence overwhelmingly points that
way](https://archive.today/20250917021133/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/09/16/tyler-robinson-what-we-know-new-revelations-in-charlie-kirk-murder/86188463007/),
then they will turn around and accuse the right of right wing violence
without any real evidence to back up their claims.

The truth matters. Objective fact matters. [I have decried it](blog:20120814) 
when the radical right was telling lies, and will decry it as long as
the radical left tells themselves lies.

### Minor blog update

I have updated my blog to break words with the slash character in them;
this nicely breaks most long URLs, and breaks compound words separated
by the slash. I, for one, never understood why the WebKit/Blink rendering
engine doesn’t break lines at the “/” character the way the Gecko engine
does.
