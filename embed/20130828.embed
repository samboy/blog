<h1>maradns.samiam.org</h1>
<h2>August 28, 2013</h2>
Just a quick heads-up that I have moved the maradns.org webpage to 
maradns.samiam.org.  maradns.org is still up and redirects all maradns.org
links to their corresponding maradns.samiam.org locations.  maradns.org
is still used to host MaraDNSâ€™s mailing list.  I have no plans to bring 
the maradns.org domain down.

<p>

The reason I have done this is to connect MaraDNS more closely to myself;
so that people are less likely to see MaraDNS as an anonymous free program
and more likely to see it as my project.

<p>

I plan to work on MaraDNS/Deadwood again one day in late September
unless a critical security bug with a CVE number is found.
