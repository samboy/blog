# Chess Cancun: A public domain font
## February 11, 2026

I present to the world Chess Cancun, a public domain 
redrawing of a well known freeware Chess font.

### Chess Cancun

_White to move and give mate_

There has not been a truly open source font I would consider
really attractive.  [Open Chess
Font](https://github.com/joshwalters/open-chess-font) is close; it’s
attractive and released under a Creative Commons license.  But it’s
not OFL nor public domain, and in some cases it’s better to have
a font which doesn’t require attribution in PDF files using
the font.

After trying to draw a Chess font myself, without much success, I have
finally bit the bullet and have redrawn a well known Chess font which was
released as “freeware”, without any formal licensing terms.  Since the
original font, which is itself based on pictures in a Chess book, was
made as a non-commercial font, its OK to redistribute the font and almost
certainly OK to use it in both commercial and non-commercial contexts.

However, the spirit of open source requires explicit permission.  That
in mind, since fonts [cannot be copyrighted in the US and many
other jurisdictions, and since font copyrights have a 25 year term 
in Germany and England, a 15 year term in 
Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property_protection_of_typefaces), 
and since the font in question is over 25 years old, I have redrawn
the font and release it to the public domain.

_Finesse Chess, a variant with fairy pieces_

I have also added support for a couple of fairy pieces for people
who like to play or solve problems for Chess variants.
