# Waffles!
## October 10, 2025

Seven years after writing an article with facts they disagreed with,
the online left-wing “woke” mob is still trying to cancel Jesse Singal.
Let me explain.

### Jesse Singal

_Jesse Singal, who the radical left has still not forgiven_

Jesse Singal is a liberal person who is not afraid to go against the
beliefs of the radical left.  For example, he [defended Alcoholics
Anonymous](https://archive.today/20191108235225/https://www.thecut.com/2015/03/why-alcoholics-anonymous-works.html)
in an era when the left wing media was using 
[questionable](blog:2025-09-10) (and ultimately
[false](https://archive.today/20250904184455/https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/03/alcoholics-anonymous-most-effective-path-to-alcohol-abstinence.html))
science to claim AA didn’t work.

He once [published an article which challenged some
assumptions transgender people 
make](https://archive.today/20251010114435/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Singal) by emphasizing the stories of people who decided they were
transgender, then changed their mind and wanted to keep their biological
gender instead.  

Since the story was published by *The Atlantic*, who also published a
[biased and inaccurate article which claimed Alcoholics Anonymous was
ineffective](blog:2025-09-10), I will assume that the article was
similarly biased and inaccurate.  But that’s not the point.

Keep in mind that *this story was published in 2018*, seven years
ago.

### Waffles and Blueskyism

Earlier this month, someone asked for Singal to be removed from the
left-wing microblogging Twitter clone Bluesky. [The CEO of 
Bluesky](https://archive.today/20251006112131/https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team)
responded by [posting 
“Waffles!”](https://archive.today/20251001182957/https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m25esnq4t22y), in reference to a thread where someone
used [Waffle House in an imaginary example of how people can be really
sanctimonious on social media](https://archive.today/20251006005954/https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/05/waffles-eat-bluesky/).

Instead of having self reflection and seeing where people can be
inappropriately bitter and resentful over something that happened nearly
a decade ago, the Bluesky mob [got really angry that someone they 
don’t like is allowed to express their views on the Bluesky
platform](https://archive.today/20251001182957/https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m25esnq4t22y).

Nate Silver even has a term for this kind of behavior, which apparently is
all too common:
[Blueskyism](https://archive.today/20251010121348/https://www.natesilver.net/p/what-is-blueskyism)

As an aside, NPR just posted [a piece on how someone got canceled for
mocking Charlie Kirk after he was 
murdered](https://archive.today/20251011141931/https://www.npr.org/2025/10/11/nx-s1-5550366/charlie-kirk-social-media-firings), but NPR has not, as I
type this, posted about how the left wing mob has gone after Singal.

Biased reporting indeed.

### Free speech

The best response to speech we do not like is more speech.  When
people lie about whether Alcoholics Anonymous works, [let’s dig
up some research showing that AA *does* work](blog:2025-09-10).
When some misogynistic guys falsely claim 80% of the women sleep with
20% of the men, [let’s post some facts showing that is not
true](blog:2025-09-06). 

To respond to information we do not like with attempts to get the
person fired or removed from social media results in more anger and
false information begin spread.

It is better to respond to heat with light, not more heat.
