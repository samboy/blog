<h1>MaraDNS 1 update</h1>

<h2>December 30, 2011</h2>

Looking closely at <A href=20111229.html>the patch I applied yesterday</A>, 
I realized that it had a couple of problems:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of the hash randomization having 24 bits of entropy, it only
had 2 to 5 bits of entropy

<li> The hash randomization would sometimes not do a good job of
randomizing the hash buckets chosen, slowing down MaraDNS' performance

</ul>

This in mind, I have release MaraDNS 1.3.07.13 and MaraDNS 1.4.09
today with both of these issues fixed.  The hash randomization now has
31 bits of entropy, and the hash does a fairly good job of choosing a
random hash bucket again.

<p>
