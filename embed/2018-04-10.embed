<h1>My new job</h1>
<h2>April 10, 2018</h2>
I have a new job.  I also look at how my old MaraDNS code is still
notable. 

<p>

<p>

While I have been very happy at Midigator, and have indeed not been
looking for a job, another company contacted me and gave me an offer
I could not refuse.  While Midigator required two phone screenings
and a in-person interview (albeit, the second to easiest in person
interview I have ever done), this job required only a single video
conference screening before they extended an offer to me, where I
mainly talked about my need for work-life balance because I am
a single parent.

<p>

Because of the amount of toxic hatred on the Internet,
<a href="http://samiam.org/blog/2017-07-08.html#Why_I_am_keeping_my_current_boss_secret">I am keeping my current employer secret</a>; just like I did with Midigator,
I will make this employer known once I am no longer working for them.
If some nutcase were to call up Midigator and tell them I should be
fired because, say, I no longer think Linux is a viable end-user desktop,
they will politely explain to them that I am already leaving and that
Friday is my last day there (yes, for the record, I gave them a full two 
week notice).

MaraDNS is still getting mentioned in notable scholarly journals.

<p>

In 2017, MaraDNS was extensively discussed in the paper
<a href="http://www.faginfamily.net/barry/Papers/Fagin%20Carlisle%20Klanderman%20COMPSAC%202017.pdf">Making DNS Servers Resistant to Cyber Attacks:  An Empirical Study on Formal Methods and Performance</a>
which was published in IEEE Xplore.  There is also a discussion about
how MaraDNS handles bailiwick processing in the 2016 paper
<a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1605/1605.01394.pdf">The Availability and Security Implications of Glue in the Domain Name System</a> (my comment:
MaraDNSâ€™ bailiwick design, which is the same in both MaraDNS 1 and in 
Deadwood/MaraDNS 2, is based on an outdated 2001 view of the internet 
and DNS).

<p>

Point being: While I have not actively added new features to MaraDNS 
since 2010, and while I now only fix security and other critical bugs
(including, yes, root server changes, though I will probably stop doing
those in a few years), MaraDNS is still considered a viable DNS server
and is still getting notable coverage.
