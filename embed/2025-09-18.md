# Factoring Jimmy Kimmel
## September 18, 2025

A Lua function for factoring numbers. And some thoughts on Jimmy Kimmel.

### Factoring numbers in Lua

This is an extension of the code I posted [yesterday](blog:2025-09-17),
and uses the `primes()` function from yesterday to factor numbers.

This function takes a number to factor as its input, and returns the
 list of prime factors in an array:

```
function factor(a)
  local out={}
  local prime=primes(a/2 + 1)
  for b = 1,#prime do
    while(a / prime[b] ==
      math.floor(a/prime[b]))
    do
      out[#out + 1] = prime[b]
      a = a / prime[b]
    end
  end
  if #out == 0 then
    out={a}
  end
  return out
end
```

This uses `primes()` from yesterday. The example usage of
the above function uses `listArray()`, also posted yesterday:

```
print(listArray(factor(48)))
```

### Jimmy Kimmel

Jimmy Kimmel was fired and his show cancelled because he [said the 
following](https://archive.ph/20250927120305/https://www.themotte.org/post/3263/culture-war-roundup-for-the-week/367811?context=8#context):

>Kirk’s killer was left-wing@.](fn:1)

Not surprisingly, [Reddit is upset about this](https://archive.today/20250918182556/https://old.reddit.com/r/popular/?geo_filter=GLOBAL),
but should they be, considering they were [cheering or 
ignoring](https://archive.today/20200708103205/https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hn0sct/a_letter_on_justice_and_open_debate/) the abuses during the out of 
control cancel culture we had in 2020.

[Garry Kasparov is also upset](https://archive.today/20250917072847/https://www.thenextmove.org/p/state-sponsored-cancel-culture-after) about the 
post-Kirk cancellations, but to be fair to him, he has always
_opposed_ cancel culture and was one of the people to sign 
[Harper’s Letter](blog:2020-07-09).

What is good for the goose is good for the gander. One cannot ignore
or cheer on cancel culture when people they disagree with get
cancelled, then turn around and bewail people cancelling people they
agree with. That’s tribal hypocrisy.

The world would be a better place if we had more people as principled
as Kasparov is. Kasparov _knew_ the out of control cancellations
were an unsound gambit, and now the boomerang is coming back to get the
extreme left wing.
