# Lua primes; etc.
## September 17, 2025

A Lua function for finding prime numbers.  Also, some links about
Charlie Kirk.

### Finding primes in Lua

This Lua function files all primes between 2 and `a`, and
returns the list of primes in an array:

```
function primes(a)
  local out = {2}
  local inComposite = false
  local c = 1
  for b=3,a,2 do
    isComposite = false
    c = 1
    while out[c]*out[c] <= b
        do
      if(b/out[c] ==
         math.floor(b/out[c]))
      then
        isComposite = true
        break
      end
      c = c + 1
    end
    if not isComposite then
      out[#out + 1] = b
    end
  end
  return out
end
```

Here’s a function for printing array elements:

```
function listArray(a)
  local out = ""
  for b=1,#a do
    out = out .. 
          tostring(a[b]) 
          .. " "
  end
  return out
end
```

Example usage of the above functions:

```
print(listArray(primes(99)))
```

### Charlie Kirk and Ryan Carson

Ryan Carson is someone who died in 2023. People on the right did some
amount of dancing on his grave after he died; how bad that dancing was
is something I will leave to the reader. Here is how the right reacted
to his death: [The Voice of Thy Brother’s Blood](https://archive.ph/SfpJa) - 
[REVEALED: Murdered leftist activist Ryan Carson has history of celebrating 
death, violence towards conservatives](https://archive.ph/gYazW)

Charlie Kirk is someone I have already [talked about](blog:2025-09-13)
in [previous blogs](blog:2025-09-11). In terms of the left dancing on his
grave, as a point of comparison, here is how someone on the left reacted to
Charlie Kirk’s death: [The World Is a Better Place Without Charlie Kirk 
In It](https://archive.ph/BaEFv)

Looking at this [short YouTube video of Charlie 
Kirk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JRWZ13JXtw), he comes off as 
someone very compassionate, even to people who have a very different
standard of morality than the morality he had—a morality which I myself
have (I have _never_ had sex outside of a lifetime monogamous
commitment).
