# Left wing bullying
## October 1, 2025

I explain why I think the allegations being made against Charlie Kirk
are false, and how the illiberal left are being a bunch of bullies.

### The illiberal left lies and bullies

I question how contentious and controversial and combative Charlie
Kirk really was. Yes, the illiberal left _says_ he was this horrible
contentious person, but I don’t believe them. Let me explain why.

A few years ago, Richard M. Stallman (RMS) was dragged through the mud
by the illiberal left. They came up with an entire Gish Gallop litany
of reasons why he was a horrible person; since he did not believe all
the doctrines of their belief system, they painted him a heretic.

[People looked at every claim](https://sterling-archermedes.github.io/)
that was [made against RMS](https://stallmansupport.org/) and found them
to be false misrepresentations. _The illiberal left flat out lied when
attacking RMS!_

Now, I haven’t looked at every single claim made against Charlie Kirk
made in these Gish Gallops of attacks against him, so I will look at just
one claim used to attack him: The claim that he advocated stoning gays.

This claim was made out of content; Charlie Kirk was making a rebuttal
to the claim that “Love your neighbor” (Luke 10:27) means we must
not consider gay pride marches sinful. He himself was not saying gay
people should be stoned to death. [This claim is so inaccurate, Stephen
King apologized for making it](https://archive.ph/UoGmp)

Point being, I know the illiberal left lied when they went after
RMS. Based on the one claim I have taken the time to investigate, they
seem to be lying again when going after Charlie Kirk.

My personal impression of Kirk is that he was a [kind and caring
person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JRWZ13JXtw) even when debating
someone he strongly disagrees with. In this five minute video which I just
linked to, he patiently listens to a pornography actress describing her
open relationship and sexual lifestyle, making a empathetic comment that
it sounds like she doesn’t have a good relationship with her father.

It’s always the kind people like Kirk and Stallman who the illiberal left
sees as targets to bully.
