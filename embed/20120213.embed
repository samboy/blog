<h1>On Ghost Domains</h1>

<h2>February 13, 2012</h2>

Earlier this month Haixin Duan, et al released the paper <A 
href=https://www.isc.org/files/imce/ghostdomain_camera.pdf>"Ghost
Domain Names: Revoked Yet Still Resolvable"</A> (PDF document).  
For people who do not have the time to read the paper, this paper 
describes how a phisher can keep a malicious domain resolving after
said domain is canceled upstream.

<p>

As it turns out, Deadwood is immune to this attack because it uses a 
different method to resolve domains than what most other DNS servers 
use.  While more complicated, Deadwood is immune to some attacks which 
other DNS servers are vulnerable to.

<p>

I describe how Deadwood resolves domains in great depth in the
following paper:

<blockquote>
<A href=http://maradns.org/deadwood/doc/Recursive-algorithm.html 
>http://maradns.org/deadwood/doc/Recursive-algorithm.html</A>
</blockquote>

<p>

Since the above document does not clarify this: Deadwood, like any
other modern DNS server, does DNS ID and source port randomization. 
Indeed, Deadwood was doing this well before Kaminsky's attack came
to surface in mid-2008.
