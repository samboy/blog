# 2020’s Cancel culture
## September 16, 2025

Let’s go over some of the more egregious examples of the cancel culture
we had in 2020.

### 2020’s Cancel Culture

There seems to be a collective amnesia among people who are left of
center about how egregious the cancel culture during the 2020 George
Floyd protests was. [One left leaning publication pretends this
kind of cancel culture started in 2023](https://archive.ph/luj7O);
however, a lot of _really bad_ cancel culture was going on in 2020.
I will only list examples that I blogged about at the time:

* Editor [James Bennet was forced to resign](blog:2020-06-08) for allowing 
  a U.S. Senator to publish a New York Times Op-Ed. 
* [David Shor was fired](blog:2020-06-16) for tweeting that 
  “Post-MLK-assasination race riots reduced Democratic vote share 
  in surrounding counties by 2%, which was enough to tip the 1968 
  election to Nixon. Non-violent protests *increase* Dem vote”.
* [Stephen Hsu was demoted](blog:2020-06-23) for linking to research
  showing that police do not disproportionally shoot black 
  people.[^1 That research may be flawed as a @https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1948550620916071 subsequent research paper@ argues](fn:1)
* [Niel Golightly was forced to resign in 2020 for something he wrote in 1987
  and subsequently apologized for](blog:2020-07-09).

So, while the exteme left wing is suddenly [clutching their 
pearls](https://archive.ph/FQeo5) that people are losing jobs for their
views, they were not complaining when [people whose views they
opposed](https://archive.ph/EBc6I) were getting fired.[^2 I find it
very ironic that this old article, supporting Bennet’s firing, links
to a diary where @https://archive.ph/cgpry a leftist is upset@ they got 
fired for their political views. While I have compassion that this person
lost their job, did they have compassion when Bennet and Shor lost their
jobs?](fn:2)

Cry me a river. Cancel culture was wrong back then, cancel culture
is wrong now, but it’s very unprincipled and tribalist to only be
crying fowl when it’s the people you oppose politically who are getting
people fired for expressing their views.

### ¡Viva México!

_Today is Mexico’s independence day_

Today, September 16^th, is [Mexico’s independence day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_%28Mexico%29). Since I now live here—I had to get away
from the toxic political environment in the US—I celebrated it last night
with my family.
