<h1>Deadwood Update</h1>
<h2>July 6, 2013</h2>
I have updated Deadwood; Deadwood has always had a limit of 20,000
fixed upstream servers.  While this does not affect normal usage of
Deadwood, people trying to have a huge blacklist in Deadwood would
be unable to resolve any domains.

<p>

The workaround is to make this silent limit more visible; Deadwood will
now complain with a fatal error if there are more than about 20,000
upstream/blacklist entries in oneâ€™s dwood3rc file.

<p>

Note that this does not affect the total number of NS referral cache entries
that Deadwood can handle, only the user-defined upstream servers.

It can be downloaded here:

This is an out of band update; while I do not actively work on new features
I still fix serious bugs (or, in this case, what 
<i>looked</i>
like a serious bug at first glance) when I become aware of them.
