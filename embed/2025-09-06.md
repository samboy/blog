# Incel myths
## September 6, 2025

I look at and refute a couple of incel myths in this blog.

### Myth #1: 80% of women sleep with 20% of women

_80/20 is a myth_

There is a myth that 80% of the women sleep of 20% of the men.  This
myth has several forms; some claim 90% of women sleep with 10% of the
men or even that 99% of the women sleep with 1% of the men.  All of 
these variants are myths.

[The science shows](https://archive.ph/wuBvu) that about 20%~30% of both
men an women are very promiscuous. Yes, 20%~30% of men have the majority
of sexual partners, but those women they are having sex with _also_ have
a lot of partners.  A certain kind of man has sex with a lot of women,
but those women he gets with in turn have sex with a lot of men.

In reality, about 20%~30% of both men and women are promiscuous, about 
50~60% of men and women only have sex in long term partnerships, and about
20% of both men and women are virgins.

### Myth #2: AF/BB is not true

AF/BB (short for “Alpha Fux, Beta Bux”) is a myth that women get together
with provider men who they are not sexually attracted to, and cheat on
those men to have children with men they are physically attracted to.
This myth is based on some mistaken ideas evolutionary psychologists had
20-30 years ago; more recent science shows that women actually only very
rarely cheat on their partners.

More recent science shows that [only a small number](https://archive.today/20170320112236/http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1772/20132400)
of children [come from cuckoldry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4611233) 
(cheating).
