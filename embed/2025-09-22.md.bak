# Reddit lies
## September 22, 2025

I go over how Reddit is being findamentally dishonest with themselves,
and how they are fooling nobody with a functional brain.

### Tyler Robinson’s motives

Tyler Robinson, who assassinated Charlie Kirk in cold blood, did it
because of Kirk’s beliefs. Let’s look at [the messages he sent to his
transgender lover](https://archive.ph/FdOQh):

>Why did I do it? [...] I had enough of his hatred. Some hate 
>can’t be negotiated out. [...] since trump got into office [my dad] has 
>been pretty diehard maga.

Let’s see here:

- He perceived Kirk as spreading a message of “hatred”.
- He was gay with a transgender biologically male lover
- He dislikes “maga” 

If it looks like a duck and quack likes a duck....yeah, he’s pretty
liberal.[^1 To address the “Groyper” theory, I should point out that
@https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groypers Groypers@ are pretty homophobic, 
considering they asked a gay person “@https://www.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-jr-book-tour-heckled-by-nationalist-group-in-rightwing-split-203719658.html How 
does anal sex help us win the culture war?@”](fn:1)

### How Reddit lies about Robinson’s motives

At first, Reddit claimed he was right wing because
[his family](https://archive.ph/OVLti) is [right
wing](https://archive.ph/BvD7U). Once it became obvious that
lie wouldn’t stick anymore, Reddit collecively moved the
goalposts and decided [he wasn’t leftist because he wasn’t
involved with a left-wing organization](https://archive.ph/JdghX).[^2
I’m sure the average Reddit poster did not think about it that much;
they saw the headline and mindlessly voted it up](fn:2)

The [article they linked to](https://archive.ph/6VvWE) flat out
says the following:

>the indictment against him says his Republican mother described him 
>as “moving to the left.”

So the article actually provides more evidence that Robinson killed
Kirk because he had leftist beliefs. Whether or not Robinson acted
alone is a red herring; the question is _did Robinson kill Kirk because
he was liberal_ and the evidence says that he did.
