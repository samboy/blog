<h1>MaraDNS update</h1>

<h2>June 10, 2011</h2>

In today's snapshot of MaraDNS:

<ul>
<li>Certain TXT record parsing errors now tell the user which man page to
    read.
<li><tt>--pid</tt> support for Duende (courtesy Yarin) backported to
    MaraDNS 2.0's Duende.
</ul>

<p>
It can be downloaded here:

Deadwood has been sending recursive DNS queries upstream with the RA
bit set.  Occasionally, this results in the upstream DNS server ignoring
Deadwood's request.  Fixed.

The next day I plan to work on MaraDNS/Deadwood is two weeks from today:
June 24, 2011.
