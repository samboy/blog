# Reddit lies
## September 22, 2025

I go over how Reddit is being findamentally dishonest with themselves,
and how they are fooling nobody with a functional brain.

### Tyler Robinson’s motives

Tyler Robinson, who assassinated Charlie Kirk in cold blood, did it
because of Kirk’s beliefs. Let’s look at [the messages he sent to his
transgender lover](https://archive.ph/FdOQh):

>Why did I do it? [...] I had enough of his hatred. Some hate 
>can’t be negotiated out. [...] since trump got into office [my dad] has 
>been pretty diehard maga.

Let’s see here:

- He perceived Kirk as spreading a message of “hatred”.
- He was gay with a transgender biologically male lover
- He dislikes “maga” 

If it looks like a duck and quack likes a duck....yeah, he’s pretty
liberal.[^1 To address the “Groyper” theory, I should point out that
@https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groypers Groypers@ are pretty homophobic, 
considering they asked a gay person “@https://www.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-jr-book-tour-heckled-by-nationalist-group-in-rightwing-split-203719658.html How 
does anal sex help us win the culture war?@”](fn:1)
