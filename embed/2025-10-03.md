# Font stacks: No more
## October 3, 2025

I explain why font stacks are no more, and why one needs to use a webfont
if they want to determine which font someone sees a webpage with.

### Font stacks in 2025?

A couple of years ago, [someone made a set of font stacks for
modern web browsers](https://modernfontstacks.com/).  While a very noble
effort, unfortunately they do not work here in 2025.

Font stacks made a lot of sense in the days of Internet Explorer 6 for
a lot of reasons:

* Dial up users did not have enough bandwidth to download webfonts.

* Only IE supported webfonts, in a weird proprietary “eot” format [^1
  I actually have @https://github.com/samboy/CaulixtlaFonts/tree/main/MiscFonts/Kilroy/obsolete EOT versions@ of the webfont used for this blog](fn:1)

* 99% of desktop operating systems all had the same web safe fonts 
  “Verdana/Georgia/Trebuchet/Times New Roman/Arial/etc.”

Things have changed a lot since then:

* 100k for a webfont package is a small file, even on a 4g network in a 
  third world country. [^2 CJK users have font files large enough where 
  the download size *might* be an issue. In that case, we either accept the 
  download size as part of a modern website, or we accept that Android users 
  will generally get Noto while Mac/Windows users will get different 
  looking system fonts.](fn:2)

* All mainstream current browsers [support](https://caniuse.com/?search=woff2) 
  woff2 webfonts. [^3 Some people will turn off webfonts, but those people 
  have made it clear they *don’t care* whether or not they get a font which 
  looks like the design the webmaster intended.](fn:3)

* On Android, font support is very limited and has no support for the old 
  school “web safe” core fonts for the web (Verdana/etc.)

Looking at those font stacks in Firefox on my Android phone, “System
UI” works, “Neo-Grotesque” gives a pencil thin font which is very
difficult to read (“Inter” on my phone is pencil thin), “Slab
Serif” actually looks nice (both in Windows, with Rockwell, and on
Android, with Roboto Slab, but note that Chrome for Android does not allow
Roboto Slab in a font stack), and “Handwritten” works for its purpose
(Android uses a “Cursive” fallback font). All the other font stacks
are giving me the system default serif/sans/mono fonts (either Noto or
Roboto). 

With Chrome on my Android phone, source sans pro is used a lot, as
well as Google specific metric compatible versions of “Arial”,
“Georgia”, “Courier New” which often times do not look like the
font they are metrically compatible with.  “Slab Serif” doesn’t work
on Chrome for Android even though Roboto Slab is installed on my Android
system. 

Point being, Android has made web safe fonts a thing of the past.

### Finding the best system fallback font

This doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have fallback fonts, of course.

There is a tool over at 
[https://screenspan.net/fallback](https://screenspan.net/fallback) 
which is very good at finding out which system font is the best fallback
font to have in the rare situations where a webfont can’t be loaded.

I use Georgia for my fallback font because it’s mostly compatible
with the metrics for my webfont, and, like my webfont, is designed to
be really easy to read on the screen.
