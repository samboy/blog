# New album released
## December 18, 2025

I am finishing off 2025 by releasing an album of some music I’ve been
working on for nearly three years.

### Trapped in the Woodland Faerie Ring

*Trapped in the Woodland Faerie Ring* is my new release of music.  I 
have been working on this music for nearly three years, and finally 
finished things up this year by taking the three best ambient pieces
I did nearly three years ago, editing them, and making an album out
of these pieces.

The first song, “Flying Far Away”, is the result of nearly three years
of work.  The song originally was a short piece, not even five minutes
long.  I have extensively edited it over three years, improving its low
end and finally, this year, converting it from a five minute song in to
an ambient drone nearly an hour long.

The other two songs are also ambient and, while edited, have not been
edited to the extent “Flying Far Away” has been.  In particular, they
retain their original lengths that they had nearly three years ago.

### The story behind the album

Starting three years ago, I went through a personal emotional crisis 
which cumulated in me moving back to Mexico and becoming a lot less
liberal than I used to be.  

I don’t regret going through this crisis:  I have made a lot of friends
online, some of whom I now talk to on the phone nearly every day, I have
become a lot more comfortable making female friends, I lost 45 pounds (20
kilos/3 stone) in three months and remain physically fit, I have dated
well over a dozen women, and am regularly Christian dating someone right
now.

And, yes, I have *finally* released some music I ended up making during
that emotional crisis.

This release is available as a [download on my Bandcamp 
page](https://caulixtla.bandcamp.com/album/trapped-in-the-woodland-faerie-ring).
