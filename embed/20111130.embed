<h1>New Deadwood snapshot</h1>

<h2>November 30, 2011</h2>

In today's snapshot of Deadwood, I have fixed a bug where the CNAME of
multi-link incomplete CNAME records would always be only 60 seconds long.
The TTL is now whatever TTL we get upstream.

<p>

This should slightly speed up resolution of multi-link incomplete
CNAME records.
