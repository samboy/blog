# The Tea app: R.I.P.
## October 24, 2025

I discuss the Tea app, which has now been pulled from the Apple 
store.

### Wholesale slander of men

[The Tea app has been](https://archive.today/20251022232943/https://www.404media.co/women-dating-safety-app-tea-delisted-from-apple-app-store/)
pulled [from the Apple store](https://archive.today/20251024132340/https://www.businessinsider.com/app-store-remove-viral-tea-dating-apps-over-privacy-violations-2025-10). 
Was it even a good idea to have this app?

This app, a “gossip” app which only women are supposed to have
access to, and used to “review” men the women may consider dating,
has been marketed as a safety app to keep women safe. However, men were
not allowed to use the app, and the app was used to spread slander about
men which the men were not allowed to see, much less respond to.@[^1
Often times female friends of a guy being slandered would let him know
what’s going on](fn:1) This is very different from, say, Yelp, since
the Tea app was talking about men’s personal lives (what a public
business does is a matter of public record), and the “reviews” (if you
will) of the men were not even *visible* to the men being “reviewed”.

In some cases [men who don’t even talk to girls had lies spread about
them on the Tea 
app](https://archive.today/20251024172732/https://nypost.com/2025/07/29/opinion/meinside-the-tea-apps-toxic-conversations/).

Earlier this summer, [pictures of some Tea app users were leaked
online](https://archive.today/20250727/https://fortune.com/2025/07/26/tea-app-hack-images-online-leaks-users-selfies/)
causing those pictures to be widely shared, including in a torrent
file. Someone even briefly had a web app up where people could rate
pictures of Tea app users.  Yes, it was a violation of privacy to do that;
on the other hand, the entire purpose of the Tea app has been to violate the
privacy of men.

For myself, having had a close friend who was slandered in a similar
Facebook group, I can not be neutral about this app being pulled from
the Apple store: It harmed a lot of men, innocent men in many cases,
and the world, in my opinion, is a better place when we don’t let men
be slandered this way.

Apple did the right thing removing this app from their app store.  
Good riddance to bad rubbish.
