# The 80/20 sex partner myth
## November 29, 2025

While I have [touched on the incel 80/20 myth in a previous 
blog](blog:2025-09-06), I want to go in to more detail on why
80/20 is a myth.

### The myth explained

_An imaginary world where 20% of men have sex with 80% of women.  The black line highlights the percentage of male and female partners the “top” 20% have._

There’s a famous scene in the Netflix series *Adolescence* where
one of the characters tells the other character there is a myth online
where 20% of the men sleep with 80% of the women.  This hateful and
misogynistic myth is one which gained ground in the 2010s among
far right online communities, including the “incel” community.  

Whether this myth originates [from a comment by one
Baumeister](https://archive.today/20200824014812/https://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/20/is-there-anything-good-about-men-and-other-tricky-questions/)
or from [a 2008 OkCupid blog entry](blog:2025-10-21), it has become
viral on social media, even though there is no
scientific evidence to support this myth.[1 The notion that women want to
cheat on their male partners when they ovulate 
@https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulatory_shift_hypothesis has been shown to be
false@.](fn:1)

That in mind, I have done some research myself to see whether this myth
is true.

Let’s us imagine a world where 20% of the men have sex with 80% of
the women.  In this imaginary world, which I have modeled, we can
see that women have a fairly linear distribution of sex partners; e.g.
26.75% of women have 40.7% of lifetime male sex partners and
99.80% of women have 100.0% of lifetime male sex partners.

Contrast this with the men in this incel fantasy, where 
20.95% of men have 81.7% of lifetime female sex partners, and there is
a nearly 50% male virginity rate.

### The actual data
![widepic](pics/80-20-NSFG2022.png)
_The actual NSFG 2022 data. The black line highlights the percentage of male and female partners the “top” 20% have._

For me to find the actual figures of reported sex partners, I looked
up the 2022 NSFG data, where they asked about 10,000 men and women how
many lifetime sex partners they have had.

I got the number of female lifetime sex partners from [page 448 of
the NSFG 2022 female 
codebook](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nsfg/codebooks/2022-2023-NSFG-FemRespPUFCodebook.pdf)
and male lifetime sex partners [page 254 of the NSFG 2022 male 
codebook](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nsfg/codebooks/2022-2023-NSFG-MalePUFCodebook.pdf).[2 Note that these are opposite sex vaginal intercourse 
partners.](fn:2)

I then took that data and made a graph of the data.  Note in particular
that:

* 32.18% of women have 79.7% of lifetime male sex partners
* 27.69% of men have 81.1% of lifetime female sex partners
* There is a 22.3% male virginity rate

Notably, both the men and women have what look to be a polynomial
distribution of partners, instead of the reasonably linear distribution
of partners among women we see when we model the imaginary 80/20 world
incels have made up.

Also, the male and female partner count distributions are very similar
to each other.  This indicates that while about 20% of men have 70% of 
the lifetime female sex partners, about 20% of women *also* have about
70% of the lifetime male sex partners.  So, while a small number of men
do, in fact, have the majority of female sex partners, the women they
are sleeping with, in turn, have a large number of male sex partners.
