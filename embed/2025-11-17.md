# Lack of empathy for men
## November 17, 2025

I look at how left wing media uses the neologism “mankeeping” to justify
women who are cold and emotionally unavailable.

### Mankeeping: Actually, that’s called “caring”

Mankeeping is a neologism which is describe by the

wing
[media](https://archive.today/20250618230335/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jun/16/mankeeping-why-single-women-are-giving-up-dating) as
“the emotional labor women end up doing in heterosexual relationships”. 
It includes basic emotional support such as helping him in stressful
situations, or caring about him when he is going through a hard time.

One article is upset that women provide this basic emotional support
because it is “unpaid, unacknowledged, and often unreciprocated”.

Very telling, providing basic care and emotional support for another
human being is only an issue with left-wing media when:

* The person who wants the caring is a man.
* The person they want the caring from is a woman.

On Reddit, they think this kind of coldness to one’s partner—having no 
empathy for their feelings—[is 
acceptable](https://archive.today/20251117053210/https://old.reddit.com/r/GetNoted/comments/1oz55w3/relationships_should_be_mutually_caring_and/).
I guess Reddit posters think it’s OK to be transactional about basic
human empathy.

On Twitter (X), there is still some basic human empathy and kindness.

got well over 20,000 likes.

I get the sense the whole “unreciprocated” thing is emotionally cold
and unavailable women justifying a lack of care for other people’s
feelings.

A couple of stories from my own life:

* I have a friend who trauma dumped on me for 30 minutes, and
  when I then started talking about my emotional needs, she couldn’t
  hang up quickly enough.  Even though I still consider her a friend,
  I don’t reach out to her nearly as often as I reach out to my
  emotionally available friends.
* I once knew a woman who was selfish, uncaring, and completely
  emotionally unavailable.  She had this dead look in her eyes like as
  though she were a zombie, and I only once saw her laugh.  If I cried in 
  front of her, she would either look away from me or she would become 
  really anxious, shifting her eyes really nervously before disengaging 
  from me as quickly as she could.  She even admitted she was an avoidant.
  She obviously suffered from severe depression and was unable to care for
  anyone, not even herself.  

There is something very toxic about left wing media where it
enables women who are unable and/or unwilling to give men basic empathy 
and compassion.
