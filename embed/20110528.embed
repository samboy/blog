<h1>Embedding web fonts</h1>

<h2>May 28, 2011</h2>

For years, web designers have been forced to select from a very limited
number of fonts for their web designs.  No longer; it is now possible to
put in arbitrary fonts in one's web page.

<p>

For example:

<p>
<style>
@font-face {
    font-family: 'FooBar';
    src: url('/fonts/webpage-2014-07-18/UserSmallCaps.woff') format('woff');
}
.ChortleR { font-family: FooBar, sans-serif; }
</style>

<h1 class=ChortleR>This is a heading</h1>

<p class=ChortleR>This is what some text looks like with a non-standard
font.  This may or may not be readable in your browser</p>

<p>

So the raw technology for embedding custom fonts is now availble.  
So, that leaves with the next challenge: Finding fonts that look really
great at the screen at all resolutions, using both Clear Type and classic
font rendering technology (read: a font with "delta hinting", a technology
that is very labor-intensive to add to a font).  Ideally, a font with an
open-source license (read: the "SIL" font license).

<p>

Looking at the <A href=http://google.com/webfonts>Google web fonts</A>, there
are a lot of really beautiful fonts, but the only one I have seen whose delta hinting
I am happy with is the monospace <A href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/family?family=Cousine">Cousine
font</A> (this font also goes by the name "Liberation Mono").  What I haven't
found is a font that can replace Verdana.

<p>

That said, the open-source <A href=http://ebensorkin.wordpress.com/>Merriweather</A>
font has a lot of promise; this would be a perfect font with really good
delta hinting (as well as italics).  Since it <i>is</i> open source, anyone can delta hint it--or
pay the designer to do the hard work.

<p>
<i>This problem was solved when Windows XP hit end of life in 2014; anything
post-XP doesnâ€™t need delta hinting to look good on the screen</i><p>

not post your comment (with or without editing).  The "Chortle" font
used in the above example is an open-source font; <A
