# The marital obligation to have sex
## October 23, 2025

I look at the Christian martial obligation to have sex.  I also
mention a couple of really good open source fonts.

### The obligation

The obligation Christians to have sex comes from the seventh
chapter of *Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians*, thusly:

>But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife,
>and let each woman have her own husband. Let the husband render
>to his wife the affection owed her, and likewise also the wife to her
>husband. The wife doesn’t have authority over her own body, but
>the husband. Likewise also the husband doesn’t have authority over his
>own body, but the wife. Don’t deprive one another, unless it is by
>consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer,
>and may be together again, that Satan doesn’t tempt you because of
>your lack of self-control.

In plain English:

* If the husband feels like having sex, the wife is obligated to have
  sex with him.
* If the wife feels like having sex, the husband is likewise obligated to
  have sex with her, even if the sex is a chore.

Some thoughts:

* It’s best if both the husband and wife are physically fit and maintain
  their bodies.
* The husband must not watch porn, and, yes, both the wife and husband must
  be faithful to each other.

Naturally, this is not something people who follow modern “woke”
culture agree with; I saw one male antifa activist call this obligation
“gross”.  There seems to be an impression with some leftist men that
sex is an obligation for women.

It is my empirical experience (with multiple people I know)
that the Christian obligation to have sex with one’s spouse benefits
the woman a lot more than it benefits the man.

### A couple of nice fonts

Recursive is a very flexible variable font which can be anywhere from a
monospace font to a proportional font.  It has a handwriting cursive style
but doesn’t have a serif style.  It’s an OFL free font available here:

Elstob is a classic serif font which is also a highly flexible variable
font (yes, it has variable optical size) available as an OFL free font:
