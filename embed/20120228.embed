<h1>Deadwood update</h1>

<h2>February 28, 2012</h2>

Today's update of Deadwood only updates the documentation:

<ul>
<li>I make it clear that it's important to adjust the cache size if
    there are a lot of root_servers and upstream_servers elements.
<li>I have split up the description of how Deadwood does recursion in
    to sections.
</ul>
