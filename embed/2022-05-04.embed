May the 4<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 0; vertical-align: 6px">th</span> be with you!  Also, I go over a short chess
game.

Today is Star Wars day, because of the word play with the expression
“May the 4<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 0; vertical-align: 6px">th</span> be with you”.

<p>

I have enjoyed all of the Star Wars movies, but my favorite remains
<i>Return of The Jedi</i>, since it was the first movie I could fully
understand when I saw it during its original release in the theaters.
Of the prequel trilogy, I like <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> the most,
and of the Disney batch of movies, I like <i>Rogue One</i> the most.

Legall de Kermeur was the best chess player in the world from around 1730
to 1755.  Since records of the moves played in chess games (game scores)
were not readily kept in that era, only one of his many games is still
extant, a very short and famous game, which I will describe here.

All chess diagrams are interactive.  Click on “<tt>&gt;</tt>” to see the next
move, “<tt>&lt;</tt>” to go back a move.  In the first diagram, it is 
also possible to click on “<tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>” to go to the beginning of a game, 
and “<tt>&gt;&gt;</tt>” to see how the game ends.  “Reset” in the other 
diagrams will move the game back to the position being illustrated.

notation</a> is used to describe the chess moves made.
