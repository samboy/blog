<h1>Font Update</h1>
<h2>December 1, 2017</h2>
I have updated the font on my websites.

<p>

<A name=Caulixtla2017_Bug_fix></A><A name=Caulixtla2017Bugfix></A><span class=moyet>==</span><span class=blogtitle><b>Caulixtla2017: Bug fix</b></span><span class=moyet>==</span>

<p>

I have replaced the fonts on my websites with Caulixtla2017.  This
is a bugfix update to Caulixtla007 (the 2016 version of the 
website font fix, which is itself a minor update to the 2014 version
of this font mix); the changes are:

<p>

<ul>
<li> I have re-hinted the bold version of the font with TTFautohint
  1.1 instead of TTFautohint 1.5.  There is a bug with the newer
  TTFautohint, where a page using the 1.5-hinted font will look
  bad (the letters distort to the point of being almost unreadable) 
  when put in a PDF file and printed with an HP Color LaserJet Pro
  MFP M277dw.  By using the older 2014 version of TTFautohint, while
  the fonts may look slightly worse on the screen in Windows, they 
  look a lot better with at least one embedded PDF rendering engine.
<li> I have added one character to the fonts: → (right arrow), because this
  is quite useful in technical docs (e.g. “Go to Start → Control Panel 
  → Network → Adapter settings”).
</ul>

<p>

Caulixtla2017 is a unified name for a combination for Source Sans Pro
Semibold (for the bold font), Bitstream Charter (for the regular and
italic fonts), and even a bit of Source Serif Pro (for the infinity
symbol in all three fonts).  I have been using this as my webpage font
<a href="http://samiam.org/blog/2014-07-04.html">since 2014</a>, and have updated it
in 2016 (updated hinting; using same font name for all three fonts to make
it easier to convert documents to use this font set in word processors;
making sure all three fonts were subsetted the exact same way).  I have
now updated it in 2017; I plan on using this font at least until mid-2020,
and probably longer than that.

<p>

The fonts can be downloaded here:

<p>

There are three primary formats for web fonts:

<p>

<ul>
<li> EOT, for old versions of Internet Explorer (Internet Explorer 4-8)
<li> WOFF, for slightly older modern browsers (Firefox and Chrome until
  a couple years ago; Safari until this year; Internet Explorer 9-11;
  Opera 12 for people who like the Presto engine)
<li> WOFF2, for current browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Microsoft 
  Edge)
</ul>

<p>

There is, of course, a good chart showing 
<a href="https://caniuse.com/woff">browser WOFF support</a> and
<a href="https://caniuse.com/woff2">browser WOFF2 support</a>.

<p>

(The was also briefly SVG webfonts in the late oughts, but that, for 
 good reason, never caught on)

<p>

Yes, the zip file has EOT versions of the fonts.  While I no longer try
to give Internet Explorer 8 users a full CSS experience with my web page,
and while Microsoft Edge no longer supports EOT fonts, the number of people
out there in who still use Windows XP online is shocking; two people in
an extended group of friends still do this (and I told both of them to 
<i>not</i> use Windows XP online unless you want to get hacked).  

<p>

Since making the 2016 version of my font, there’s a lot less reason to
have a WOFF (instead of WOFF2) version of the fonts; Safari has finally
added WOFF2 support so the only browsers which support WOFF but
not WOFF2 are ones which have not been updated.  The only reason to
use WOFF these days is for Internet Explorer 11 users who have not
moved on to Microsoft Edge or another modern browser.

<p>

That said, I made both WOFF and WOFF2 web versions of the fonts.

<p>

Here are some links to EOT, WOFF, and WOFF2 conversion programs (no,
I do not use an online service):

  <A href="https://www.w3.org/Tools/eot-utils/">https://www.w3.org/Tools/eot-utils/</A> (POSIX; does not compress)
</ul>

<p>

Since there’s a bug in Fontforge where it moves the underline location
when I import from a TTF file, I have also made the Fontforge source to
the fonts available.
