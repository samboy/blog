<h3>The myth explained</h3>
<img class=widepic src="pics/80-20-Imaginary.png" alt="">
<br class=nomobile>
<em>An imaginary 
 world where 20% of men have sex with 80% of women.  In this graph, the
 further away the blue line representing men is away from the red line
 representing women, the more polygyny (men having multiple female
 sex partners, where the women are excusive with the man) there is.  The 
 dark grey line highlights the percentage of male and female partners the 
 “top” 20% have.</em>

<p>
<a href="#top"><i>Back to top</i></a>

<p>There’s a famous scene in the Netflix series <em>Adolescence</em>
 where one of the characters tells the other character there is a myth
 online where 20% of the men sleep with 80% of the women. This hateful
 and misogynistic myth is one which gained ground in the 2010s among
 far right online communities, including the “incel” community.
<p>Whether this myth originates <a href="https://archive.today/20200824014812/https://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/20/is-there-anything-good-about-men-and-other-tricky-questions/">from a comment by one Baumeister</a> 
or from <a href="index.html#BlogEntry-2025-10-21">a 2008 OkCupid blog entry</a>, 
it has become viral on social media, even
 though there is no scientific evidence to support this myth.<sup style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 0; vertical-align: 5px"><a id="back-2025-11-29-1"><a href="#2025-11-29-1">1</a></a></sup>
<p>That in mind, I have done some research myself to see whether this
 myth is true.
<p>

Let’s us imagine a world where 20% of the men have sex with 80% of
the women. In this imaginary world, which I have modeled, we can see
that women have a fairly linear distribution of sex partners; e.g.
26.75% of women have 40.7% of lifetime male sex partners and 99.80% of
women have 100.0% of lifetime male sex partners.
<p>

Contrast this with the men in this incel fantasy, where 20.95% of men
have 81.7% of lifetime female sex partners, and there is a nearly 50%
male virginity rate.

<a name="2025-11-29-the-actual-data"> </a>
<h3>The actual data</h3>
<img class=widepic src="pics/80-20-NSFG2022.png" alt="">
<br class=nomobile>
<em>The actual NSFG
 2022 data.  This is a “banana curve”; since the curves representing
 women and men both bow downwards, this shows a relative minority of people
 are promiscuous.  Since the lines are close to each other, there is
 not much polygyny, but instead promiscuous men by and large have sex with
 promiscuous women. The black line highlights the percentage of male and
 female partners the “top” 20% have.</em>

<p>

<a href="#top"><i>Back to top</i></a><p>

For me to find the actual figures of reported sex partners, I looked
 up the 2022 NSFG data, where they asked about 10,000 men and women how
 many lifetime sex partners they have had.
<p>I got the number of female lifetime sex partners from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nsfg/codebooks/2022-2023-NSFG-FemRespPUFCodebook.pdf">page 448 of the NSFG 2022 female  codebook</a> 
and male lifetime sex
 partners <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nsfg/codebooks/2022-2023-NSFG-MalePUFCodebook.pdf">page 254 of the NSFG 2022 male  codebook</a>.<sup style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 0; vertical-align: 5px"><a id="back-2025-11-29-2"><a href="#2025-11-29-2">2</a></a></sup>
<p>I then took that data and made a graph of the data. Note in
 particular that:
<ul>
<li>32.18% of women have 79.7% of lifetime male sex partners
<li>27.69% of men have 81.1% of lifetime female sex partners
<li>There is a 22.3% male virginity rate
</ul>
<p>

Notably, both the men and women have what look to be a polynomial
distribution of partners, instead of the reasonably linear distribution
of partners among women we see when we model the imaginary 80/20 world
incels have made up.

<p>

Also, the male and female partner count distributions are very
similar to each other. This indicates that while about 20% of men have
70% of the lifetime female sex partners, about 20% of women <em>also</em>
have about 70% of the lifetime male sex partners. So, while a small
number of men do, in fact, have the majority of female sex partners,
the women they are sleeping with, in turn, have a large number of male
sex partners.

The files used to process this data and generate these graphs are

I will explain some of the methodology below.

<a name="simulated"> </a>
<h3>The simulated incel fantasy</h3>


<p>

<a href="#top"><i>Back to top</i></a><p>

While it’s possible to choose, when a sexual encounter happens, to have
the woman randomly choose one of the “alpha” guys 80% of the time and
one of the “beta” guys 20% of the time, the code actually uses a curve.

<p>

Let’s look at the math to make such a curve:

<p>
<img src=pics/80-20-math-1.png width=300px>

<p>
In order to make the integration as simple as possible, let’s have
<i>f(x)</i> be a polynomial:

<p>
<img src=pics/80-20-math-2.png width=300px>

<p>
Let’s integrate that equation:

<p>
<img src=pics/80-20-math-3.png width=300px>

<p>
Then simplify:

<p>
<img src=pics/80-20-math-4.png width=200px>

<p>
For <i>n</i> = 6, <img src=pics/80-20-math-5.png width=75px> is 
about 0.7902848 and
<img src=pics/80-20-math-6.png width=75px> is about 0.8388608; those values
are close enough to 80/20 and keep the math relatively simple.<sup 
style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 0; vertical-align: 5px"
><a name=bn3><a href="#fn3">3</a></a></sup>

<p>
That in mind, we do the following when choosing which man will have a
sexual encounter with a new partner:

<ul>
<li>We choose a random point (<i>x,y</i>) where both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
are random numbers between 0 and 1
<li>If the point ends up below the curve <i>y=x<sup style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 0; vertical-align: 5px">6</sup></i>, we keep the values of <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i>
<li>If the point is not below this curve, we choose another random point
until we find one below the curve (maximum tries: 100 times)
<li>We then multiply <i>x</i> by 10,000 (the number of men in our
simulation), round to the nearest integer, and that man will now have 
a sexual encounter
<li>Now that we have determined which man has a sexual encounter, we
randomly choose which one of the 10,000 women in our simulation he
will have the encounter with
</ul>

The simulation has 61,000 sexual encounters with a new parter, which is
approximately 10,000 multiplied by the mean number of partners women in
the 2022 NSFG data have.

<p>

As an aside, this is how we could calculate the precise value to give 
<i>n</i> for a given distribution of imaginary “alpha” men in
the <i>x<sup style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 0; 
vertical-align: 5px">n</sup></i> function (Note: <i>n</i> has a value of
6 in the actual simulation we ran):

<p>
<img src=pics/80-20-math-7.png width=200px>
<p>

When <i>k</i> has a value of 80% (0.8), this simulates 80/20 (80% of the 
women sleep with 20% of the men), and the above equation gives a
precise solution for <i>n</i> in this equation:

<p>
<img src=pics/80-20-math-2.png width=300px>
<p>

By dividing those two logarithms and subtracting one,
we create an exponential degree <i>n</i> such that the curve 
<i>y = x<sup style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 0;
vertical-align: 5px">n</sup></i> has the property that the area below 
the curve between 0 to 0.8
is one fourth of the area below the curve from 0.8 to 1.  <i>k</i>,
having a value of 80% (0.8), represents an imaginary world where 80%
of the women sleep with 20% of the men.  

<p>

If we want to create an curve representing a fantasy world where 90% 
of the women sleep with 10% of the men, <i>k</i> would have a value 
of 0.9 (90%) with that equation and that curve function.  In the 
resulting curve, the area below the curve from 0 to 0.9 is one nineth
of the area below the curve from 0.9 to 1.  One nineth because 90 in
90/10 is nine times the value of 10.

<p>

To calculate this in Lua, here <tt>k</tt> is a number between 0 and 1:

<pre>
function chad(k)
  return math.log(1-k) /
         math.log(k) - 1
end
</pre>

For 80/20, the value of <i>n</i> is about 6.212567; for 90/10, the 
value is about 20.8543; and for 95/5, the value is about 57.404.

<h3>Addressing incel comments</h3>

<p>
<a href="#top"><i>Back to top</i></a><p>

I will address some of the comments incels who refuse to believe this have
made:

<ul>
<li>2011 NSFG figures give similar numbers: While the most promiscuous
  are less promiscuous, and the number of virgins was lower back then,
  the general trend of the most promiscuous women being roughly as 
  promiscuous as the most promiscuous men was true.  Other surveys besides 
  NSFG give similar figures where notably the most promiscuous women are 
  about as promiscuous as the most promiscuous men.
<li>I normalize for over/under reporting by looking at the percentage of 
  total partners by gender.
<li>For women and men to lie such that the number of very promiscuous 
  women is about the same as the number of very promiscuous men would 
  require a conspiracy.
<li>Incels frequently change their argument, claiming that the fundamental
  claim isn’t that 80% of women sleep with 20% of men, but that 80% of
  women are attracted to only 20% of men.  This is moving goalposts,
  but the claim that women are attracted to only 20% of men, or more
  precisely, that women are attracted to only 20% of men while ovulating,
  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulatory_shift_hypothesis>has
  been shown to be false</a>.
<li>Incels claim that <a
href=https://web.archive.org/web/20230319132910/https://amj.kma.re.kr/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1597&context=journal>this
  article</a> shows that 80% of the women sleep with 20% of the men.  The 
  article is exclusively about dating apps, which do not represent real
  world dating (dating apps are <a href="https://archive.ph/20240915155405/https://martinvidal.medium.com/dating-apps-are-setting-men-and-women-up-for-failure-but-for-different-reasons-f56ab44d2c71">roughly 
  70% men and 30% women</a>) and the
  article points out that men can get more swipes with better pictures.
  <a href="index.html#2025-10-21-the-ok-cupid-chart">I blog elsewhere
  about how women can’t really build attraction from just a picture the
  way men often times do</a>.
<li>As a follow-up to the last point, incels claim, based on a 2019 survey,
  that everyone meets each other these days on dating apps.  These results
  have not been replicated; e.g. <a href="https://archive.today/20251202130806/https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study">this
  2024 survey shows that only 27% of people getting married met each other on 
  a dating site or app</a>.
<li>The issue with dating apps is that they are perceived to be for short
  term sexual hook ups.  This explains why they are mostly men, and this
  explains why they don’t follow the patterns we see in the real world.
<li>Speaking of dating apps, <a
href="https://archive.ph/20251215124922/https://www.keeper.ai/"
>this app has nearly seven women for every man</a>.  This is probably
why: “Every member is screened for long-term intent. Casual daters 
are banned.”
<li>The claim that there are more single men than women in their 20s
  has been addressed in <a href="https://archive.ph/20231229104847/https://nuancepill.com/what-explains-the-young-singleness-gap/">an article
  someone else wrote</a>.  To summarize: Slightly older men date slightly
  younger women.
<li>Some incels claim it’s different for people 18-29 years old.  I have made
  a graph for 18-29 year olds, and the numbers are essentially the same.
  Further discussion below.
<li>One incel assertion is that twice as many women reproduce compared to 
  men (either historically and/or presently). This is not true; 
  see <a href=https://archive.ph/20240130151114/https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/37926/of-all-humans-ever-born-did-most-men-not-become-fathers>this
  discussion</a> and <a href=https://archive.today/20250115103718/https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2833377/>this peer reviewed paper</a>.  
  To summarize: “1.4 [women reproduced for every man] in the Yoruba from 
  West Africa, 1.3 in Europeans, and 1.1 in East Asian samples.”
<li>Incels claim “mid” women only want the most attractive of men, but
a <a href="https://archive.ph/20250814042958/https://news.ufl.edu/2024/06/attractiveness-ratings/"
>study</a> shows that “We date, marry people who are attractive as we are”.
<li>Incels claim that men with high partner counts are more attractive to
women, but <a 
href="https://archive.ph/20251216050815/https://ifstudies.org/blog/men-and-women-with-multiple-sex-partners-are-less-desirable-as-long-term-mates"
>that is not what the evidence says</a>.
<li>Incels claim that only certain men are “alpha” men, and that women are 
only attracted to those “alphas”.  The whole alpha/beta idea comes from
<a href="https://archive.ph/20250309071955/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-the-alpha-wolf-idea-a-myth/"
>studies which have since been discredited</a>.
<li>Not an incel talking point <i>per se</i>, but it looks like <a
href="https://archive.ph/20220906010814/https://ifstudies.org/blog/male-sexlessness-is-rising-but-not-for-the-reasons-incels-claim"

<h3>What about the 18-29 year olds?</h3>
<img class=widepic src="pics/80-20-18-29-NSFG2022.png" alt="">
<br class=nomobile>
<em>NSFG 2022 data including data for just youth aged 18-29.  The dark 
 grey line highlights the percentage of male and female partners the 
 “top” 20% have.</em>

<p>

<a href="#top"><i>Back to top</i></a><p>

I have run the stats on just 18-29 year olds and the numbers are not that
different than they are for all ages.  

<p>

If anything, the trend of there being more virgins of both genders as
well as the most promiscuous people being even more promiscuous continues:
While the “top” 20% of men have more partners compared to all ages, the
“top” 20% of women also have more partners.

<p>

In more detail:

<ul>
<li>20.66% of men (18-29) have 75.7% of lifetime female sex partners
<li>19.96% of women (18-29) have 68.0% of lifetime male sex partners
<li>Virginity rates for 18-29 year olds: 30% men, 25% women
<li>19.45% of men (all ages) have 71.5% of lifetime female sex partners
<li>19.49% of women (all ages) have 64.8% of lifetime male sex partners
<li>Virginity rates for all ages: 22% men, 18% women
</ul>

Note that:

<ul>
<li>The most promiscuous people have even more sex partners, for both
    men and women
<li>In particular, the difference between all ages and 18-29 is that the 
    “top” 20% have 3-4% more of the lifetime partner count, again for both men 
    and women
<li>Virginity rates are about 8% higher with younger people, once 
    again for both men and women
</ul>

<a name="conclusion"> </a>
<h3>Some final thoughts</h3>
<p>

<a href="#top"><i>Back to top</i></a><p>

There <i>is</i> a slight skew, where about 5% of men (if even that) are 
polygynic, and about 5% more men than women are virgins, but it’s nowhere 
near 80/20.
