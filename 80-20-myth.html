<h1>The 80/20 sex partner myth</h1>
<h2>November 29, 2025</h2>
While I have <a href="index.html#BlogEntry-2025-09-06">touched on the incel 80/20 myth in a previous  blog</a>, 
I want to go in
 to more detail on why 80/<![if gt IE 6]>&#8203;<![endif]><wbr>20 is a myth.
<a name="2025-11-29-the-myth-explained"> </a>
<h3>The myth explained</h3>
<img class=widepic src="pics/80-20-Imaginary.png" alt="">
<br class=nomobile>
<em>An imaginary 
 world where 20% of men have sex with 80% of women.  The black line
 highlights the percentage of male and female partners the “top” 20%
 have.</em>
<p>There’s a famous scene in the Netflix series <em>Adolescence</em>
 where one of the characters tells the other character there is a myth
 online where 20% of the men sleep with 80% of the women. This hateful
 and misogynistic myth is one which gained ground in the 2010s among
 far right online communities, including the “incel” community.
<p>Whether this myth originates <a href="https://archive.today/20200824014812/https://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/20/is-there-anything-good-about-men-and-other-tricky-questions/">from a comment by one Baumeister</a> 
or from <a href="index.html#BlogEntry-2025-10-21">a 2008 OkCupid blog entry</a>, 
it has become viral on social media, even
 though there is no scientific evidence to support this myth.<sup style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 0; vertical-align: 5px"><a id="back-2025-11-29-1"><a href="#2025-11-29-1">1</a></a></sup>
<p>That in mind, I have done some research myself to see whether this
 myth is true.
<p>

Let’s us imagine a world where 20% of the men have sex with 80% of
the women. In this imaginary world, which I have modeled, we can see
that women have a fairly linear distribution of sex partners; e.g.
26.75% of women have 40.7% of lifetime male sex partners and 99.80% of
women have 100.0% of lifetime male sex partners.
<p>

Contrast this with the men in this incel fantasy, where 20.95% of men
have 81.7% of lifetime female sex partners, and there is a nearly 50%
male virginity rate.

<a name="2025-11-29-the-actual-data"> </a>
<h3>The actual data</h3>
<img class=widepic src="pics/80-20-NSFG2022.png" alt="">
<br class=nomobile>
<em>The actual NSFG 
 2022 data.  The black line
 highlights the percentage of male and female partners the “top” 20%
 have.</em>
<p>For me to find the actual figures of reported sex partners, I looked
 up the 2022 NSFG data, where they asked about 10,000 men and women how
 many lifetime sex partners they have had.
<p>I got the number of female lifetime sex partners from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nsfg/codebooks/2022-2023-NSFG-FemRespPUFCodebook.pdf">page 448 of the NSFG 2022 female  codebook</a> 
and male lifetime sex
 partners <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nsfg/codebooks/2022-2023-NSFG-MalePUFCodebook.pdf">page 254 of the NSFG 2022 male  codebook</a>.<sup style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 0; vertical-align: 5px"><a id="back-2025-11-29-2"><a href="#2025-11-29-2">2</a></a></sup>
<p>I then took that data and made a graph of the data. Note in
 particular that:
<ul>
<li>32.18% of women have 79.7% of lifetime male sex partners
<li>27.69% of men have 81.1% of lifetime female sex partners
<li>There is a 22.3% male virginity rate
</ul>
<p>

Notably, both the men and women have what look to be a polynomial
distribution of partners, instead of the reasonably linear distribution
of partners among women we see when we model the imaginary 80/20 world
incels have made up.

<p>

Also, the male and female partner count distributions are very
similar to each other. This indicates that while about 20% of men have
70% of the lifetime female sex partners, about 20% of women <em>also</em>
have about 70% of the lifetime male sex partners. So, while a small
number of men do, in fact, have the majority of female sex partners,
the women they are sleeping with, in turn, have a large number of male
sex partners.

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>

The files used to process this data and generate these graphs are
available here:

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/samboy/blog/tree/main/80-20-myth">https:/<![if gt IE 6]>&#8203;<![endif]><wbr>/<![if gt IE 6]>&#8203;<![endif]><wbr>github.com/<![if gt IE 6]>&#8203;<![endif]><wbr>samboy/<![if gt IE 6]>&#8203;<![endif]><wbr>blog/<![if gt IE 6]>&#8203;<![endif]><wbr>tree/<![if gt IE 6]>&#8203;<![endif]><wbr>main/<![if gt IE 6]>&#8203;<![endif]><wbr>80-20-myth</a>
</blockquote>

I will explain some of the methodology below.

<h3>The simulated incel fantasy</h3>

<p>

While it’s possible to choose, when a sexual encounter happens, to have
the woman randomly choose one of the “alpha” guys 80% of the time and
one of the “beta” guys 20% of the time, the code actually uses a curve.

<p>

Let’s look at the math to make such a curve:

<p>
<img src=pics/80-20-math-1.png width=300px>

<p>
In order to make the integration as simple as possible, let’s have
<i>f(x)</i> be a polynomial:

<p>
<img src=pics/80-20-math-2.png width=300px>

<p>
Let’s integrate that equation:

<p>
<img src=pics/80-20-math-3.png width=300px>

<p>
Then simplify:

<p>
<img src=pics/80-20-math-4.png width=200px>

<p>
For <i>n</i> = 6, <img src=pics/80-20-math-5.png width=75px> is 
about 0.7902848 and
<img src=pics/80-20-math-6.png width=75px> is about 0.8388608; those values
are close enough to 80/20 and keep the math relatively simple.<sup 
style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 0; vertical-align: 5px"
><a name=bn3><a href="#fn3">3</a></a></sup>

<p>
That in mind, we do the following when choosing which man will have a
sexual encounter with a new partner:

<ul>
<li>We choose a random point (<i>x,y</i>) where both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
are random numbers between 0 and 1
<li>If the point ends up below the curve <i>y=x<sup style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 0; vertical-align: 5px">6</sup></i>, we keep the values of <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i>
<li>If the point is not below this curve, we choose another random point
until we find one below the curve (maximum tries: 100 times)
<li>We then multiply <i>x</i> by 10,000 (the number of men in our
simulation), round to the nearest integer, and that man will now have 
a sexual encounter
<li>Now that we have determined which man has a sexual encounter, we
randomly choose which one of the 10,000 women in our simulation he
will have the encounter with
</ul>

The simulation has 61,000 sexual encounters with a new parter, which is
approximately 10,000 multiplied by the mean number of partners women in
the 2022 NSFG data have.

<h3>Addressing incel comments</h3>

<p>

I will address some of the comments incels who refuse to believe this have
made:

<ul>
<li>2011 NSFG figures give similar numbers: While the most promiscuous
  are less promiscuous, and the number of virgins was lower back then,
  the general trend of the most promiscuous women being roughly as 
  promiscuous as the most promiscuous men was true.  Other surveys besides 
  NSFG give similar figures where notably the most promiscuous women are 
  about as promiscuous as the most promiscuous men.
<li>I normalize for over/under reporting by looking at the percentage of 
  total partners by gender.
<li>For women and men to lie such that the number of very promiscuous 
  women is about the same as the number of very promiscuous men would 
  require a conspiracy.
<li>Incels frequently change their argument, claiming that the fundamental
  claim isn’t that 80% of women sleep with 20% of men, but that 80% of
  women are attracted to only 20% of men.  This is moving goalposts,
  but the claim that women are attracted to only 20% of men, or more
  precisely, that women are attracted to only 20% of men while ovulating,
  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulatory_shift_hypothesis>has
  been shown to be false</a>.
<li>Incels claim that <a
href=https://web.archive.org/web/20230319132910/https://amj.kma.re.kr/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1597&context=journal>this
  article</a> shows that 80% of the women sleep with 20% of the men.  The 
  article is exclusively about dating apps, which do not represent real
  world dating (dating apps are <a href="https://archive.ph/20240915155405/https://martinvidal.medium.com/dating-apps-are-setting-men-and-women-up-for-failure-but-for-different-reasons-f56ab44d2c71">roughly 
  70% men and 30% women</a>) and the
  article points out that men can get more swipes with better pictures.
  <a href="index.html#2025-10-21-the-ok-cupid-chart">I blog elsewhere
  about how women can’t really build attraction from just a picture the
  way men often times do</a>.
<li>The claim that there are more single men than women in their 20s
  has been addressed in <a href="https://archive.ph/20231229104847/https://nuancepill.com/what-explains-the-young-singleness-gap/">an article
  someone else wrote</a>.  To summarize: Slightly older men date slightly
  younger women.
<li>Not an incel talking point <i>per se</i>, but it looks like <a
href="https://archive.ph/20220906010814/https://ifstudies.org/blog/male-sexlessness-is-rising-but-not-for-the-reasons-incels-claim"
  >only about 5% of men are actually incels</a>.
</ul>
