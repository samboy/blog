<p>This document describes how to use the HTMLDOC software. HTMLDOC reads HTML and Markdown source files or web pages and generates corresponding EPUB, HTML, PostScript, or PDF files with an optional table of contents. HTMLDOC can be used as a standalone application, in a batch document processing environment, or as a web-based report generation application.</p>

<p>HTMLDOC is open source software under the terms of version 2 of the GNU General Public License. No restrictions are placed upon the output produced by HTMLDOC.</p>


<h2>History</h2>

<p>Like many programs, I developed HTMLDOC in response to a need my company had for generating high-quality documentation in printed and electronic forms. For a while I used FrameMaker&reg; and a package from <code>sgi</code> that generated "compiled" Standard Generalized Markup Language ("SGML") files that could be used by the Electronic Book Technologies ("EBT") documentation products; EBT was bought by INSO who was bought by Stellent<sup>TM</sup> who apparently has dropped the whole product line. When <code>sgi</code> stopped supporting these tools I turned to INSO, but the cost of their tools was prohibitive to my small business.</p>

<p>In the end I decided to write my own program to generate the documentation. HTML seemed to be the source format of choice since WYSIWYG HTML editors are widely (and freely) available and at worst you can use a plain text editor. I needed HTML output for documentation on my web server, PDF for customers to read and/or print from their computers, and PostScript for printing needs.</p>

<p>The result of my efforts is the HTMLDOC software which runs on Linux&reg;, macOS&reg;, Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;, and most UNIX&reg; operating systems. Among other things, this software users manual is produced using HTMLDOC.</p>

<p>HTMLDOC used to be available under a commercial end-user license agreement from my former company, Easy Software Products. While that company is no longer in business, I continue to maintain HTMLDOC in my spare time.</p>
